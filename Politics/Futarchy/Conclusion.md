We've explored the idea of using the successes of speculative markets as info aggregation mechanisms to help mitigate the failures of democracies as info aggregation mechanisms.

Under a new form of governance, we could formally defer to betting markets on matters of act, while retaining representative democracy on matters of value.

That is, we could vote on values but bet on beliefs.

After reviewing [[Info Failures of Democracy|democratic failures]], [[Info Successes of Speculative Markets|speculative market sucesses]], [[Decision Market Mechanics|and the mechanics of decision markets]], we considered [[Objections|twenty-five design issues with the concept]].

If after this examination, the concept passes the low threshold of "promising", the next appropriate step would be to test simple prototypes in simple test environments. Mathematical models could be constructed, and laboratory experiments could compare simple versions of this concept to a more familiar democracy in simple info environments. Laboratory successes might then prompt larger trials, such as for key decisions in a form or other organizations. Eventually, some government agency might try agency-level decision-making, such as with monetary policy.

Later, some nation might try to change its form of government. This would probably be a relatively peripheral nation, as such nations tend more to be the source of democratic innovations.
