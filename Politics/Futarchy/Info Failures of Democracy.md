How well-informed is current democratic policy? Empirical research from half a century ago seems to confirm the worst fears of democratic skeptics.

> Few citizens paid much attention to politics . . . Even on important issues such as government help with jobs, aid to education, or the stationing of American troops abroad, large proportions of the public did not know what the government was currently doing, where the opposing parties stood, or even what they themselves wanted to government to do. . . . Less than 20% . . . had real and stable attitudes on . . . electric power and housing.

Such ignorance continues today. Only 29% of US adults can name their House representative, and only 24% can identify the first amendment of the US constitution.

Voter info problems need not be a severe issue. It should suffice to have policies chosen by a single central leader, and to have voters evaluate that leader retrospectively based on whether local outcomes visible in their personal lives seem better than expected. 

The problem with this is votes are often based on beliefs about outcomes experienced by millions of others, and often rely heavily on prospective policy evaluation. Also, since power is divided, voters must discern which politicians are responsible for which outcomes.

Voters have many information aids. They collect info as a side effect of living, large elections average individual errors, and political entrepreneurs advertise. So if voters can identify well-informed sources with incentives to honestly share info, voters can defer to such sources. The problem here is voters have little chance to be pivotal in their voting or lobbying, and so they only have weak incentive to use such sources well. 

Rational but ignorant voters could recognize their info problem and reduce it by being more uncertain about their opinions, more suspicion of sources, and more open to ways to mitigate their ignorance. In reality, voters are not just ignorant but overconfident in their political views and sources, and disinterested in mitigating mechanisms.

Some  say voters have stable coherent opinions and learn what they need via cheap info shortcuts. But more plausibly, most voters are "rationally irrational". Seeing "one man one vote" as validating their opinions.

A proud unwillingness to defer to expert opinion seems confirmed in consistent differences between public and expert opinions. Relative to public opinion, expert toxicologists worry tend to estimate lower risks and higher benefits from using chemicals; Expert economists worry less about foreign aid and down-sizing and more about reduced productivity growth; these tendencies remain in the well-educated, after controlling for age, income, and ideology.

While better info sources can help rational but ignorant voters, arrogant and ignorant voters may ignore such sources, forcing politicians and policy makers to ignore them. Public policy often seems closer to public opinion than to what relevant experts advise; governments often use expert advisors more to legitimate predetermined policies than to gain info to determine policy.

While many factors contribute to bad policy, it seems hard to imagine nations adopting them nearly as often if most everyone knew they were bad. Thus an important contribution to bad policy is a failure to aggregate relevant info and put it in the hands of decision makers with sufficient incentives to notice and use that info.
