Let's try to identify and briefly discuss design issues.

*1. Maybe Poor Info Is Not Democracy's Major Failing*

What if democracy's biggest problem is coordination or commitment failure, or preventing the government from being overthrown? If so, this new form of government might still be attractive if it didn't make this bigger problem much worse, and if it were compatible with whatever reforms could reduce this bigger problem.

*2. We Should Appeal To Higher Motives Than Money*

If we could reliably pay off bets in higher forms of value, we might want to do so. We want to induce people to tell us what they know, and as a reward we need to offer them something that we can reliably produce, distribute in controlled amounts, and know that most people value. Only money now satisfies these reqiuirements.

*3. A Market-Based Approach Is Biased In Favor of Markets*

Even though the mechanism of betting on beliefs is market-based, it need not favor markets. It could in principle approve anything from an extreme socialism to an extreme minarchy, depending on what legislators say they want, and on what speculators think will achieve those goals. We do need some community of speculators who have assets they are free to bet, and we need some extra benefits to accrue to those who win their bets. These benefits need not be large, however, nor need the community of speculators be large.

There is an old Marxist saying: a capitalist will sell you the rope to hang him with. Market speculators who where rich and selfish could easily approve policies that greatly hurt the rich.

*4. People Might Reveal Less and Lie More*

Perhaps many people now talk about their politically relevant info because they feel it's their civic duty. If betting markets became available, and civic duty were fragile, then such people might be tempted to keep quiet or lie about their info, to benefit from related bets.

In speculative markets, the incentive to keep quiet about one's info is strongest before one trades on it. As on makes more trades, one approaches budget bounds that limit further trades. One is then increasingly tempted to publicly reveal one's info, to persuade other speculators and move the price favorably.

One could then reverse prior trades for profit, generating cash to allow this whole process to be repeated on other info. Thus info should be revealed via both bets and talk. 

The option to bet on politics increases incentives to lie, but today lies are limited much more by a limited willingness to believe lies than by a limited willingness to tell lies. Those seeking to avoid lies have long been well-advised to carefully consider the track records and incentives of their sources. With decision markets, the public will have a new powerful way to avoid lies: ignore the talk and just look at market prices.

*5. Expressive Voting Could Still Cause Problems*

Voters often seem to vote expressively, that is, to care less about the policies their votes may influence then about how their votes will make them look and feel.  Voters may want to show they are tough or that they care, and they may want to have people they like represent them. These may be worthwhile goals but policy choices can suffer as a result. By limiting democracy primarily to values, we would presumably focus voters more on expressing their values, rather than their beliefs. It's not clear this would make expressive voting more or less of a problem overall.

*6. The Rich Would Get More Influence*

Betting markets are not opinion polls where the rich get more votes. The rich have more potential votes, but they lose those votes if they use them without having proportionally more info. And the rich do not tend to throw their money away easily; those who do tend to not stay rich long. Also, those rich in money but poor in info will have incentives to seek out and team with those rich in info but poor in money.

Note there's also the option to limit how much money each person can use to trade on policy proposals, though this might well reduce the accuracy of market estimates. Today, civil servants have far more info influence on policy than do most citizens. This inequality is mostly seen as good, as it allows more total info via specialization. Unequal info influence in markets can also be good, for the same reason.

*7. One Profits Little By Supporting Unlikely Proposals*

Imagine you liked a proposal, but few agreed with you. Because your opponents have consistently held down the market estimate of national welfare given your proposal, your proposal has never been tried, and so you have never been rewarded, and they have never been punished, for your being right.

All political systems have similar problems. In this system, the insights that tell you that your untried proposal is promising are probably also useful for predicting the consequences of actually adopted proposals. If you prove yourself by winning bets on those topics, you will gain money and credibility to better argue for your untried proposal.

*8. Markets Might Be Too Thin To Make Good Estimates*

If decision markets were very thin or noisy, the relevant price differences would usually not be clear enough, and so the status quo might not change when it should. A market known to influence important policies, however, simply cannot be thin. If a very thin market were to influence policy, interested parties could pay very little to move the price and favorably influence policy. If interested parties on both sides had similar budgets, their combined trades would thicken the market. Alternatively, if one side could spend much more, then speculators who knew this could make easy profits by trading against that better funded side, again thickening the market.

Either way, the market would not be thin.

*9. One Rich Fool Could Do Great Damage*

Even Bill Gates has only a tiny fraction of the wealth compared to all market speculators. So if most speculators were confident that he was wrong on a market estimate, even Bill Gates could not substantially change that estimate.

If Gates pushed the price one way, those speculators would push it back. More likely, however, speculators would allow Gates to move the price some because they reasonably suspect that he had access to relevant info. Given his success, this would not be unreasonable.

*10. People Could Buy Policy Via Trades*

If market prices determine policy, and if trades predictably change prices, then interested parties could make trades that predictably influence policy. Someone with an unexpectedly strong desire to raise the market estimate of a particular stadium's profitability could succeed in doing so.

However, market speculators would have already corrected for an average expected desire to bias the price, and have increased their willingness to collect info and trade to match expected variation in such hidden desires. So every case where a manipulator raises the price too high must be matched by an equally likely case where the price is made too low, even if manipulators wanted on average to raise it. As discussed in [[Info Successes of Speculative Markets]] the more manipulation is expected, the more accurate the prices. This is also why one needn't worry about a nation's enemies hurting it via adding misleading trades. On average, adding noisy trades *increases* price accuracy.

*11. If Such Markets Are So Useful, Why Don't They Exist Now?*

Such markets are mostly illegal. The history of financial regulation is basically: everything legal today was once banned as gambling (or usury) until an exception was granted for a new legitimized higher purpose.

We might thus hope to someday legitimate and legalize markets whose main function is to aggregate info on important policies.

*12. People Could Do Harm to Win Bets*

People are sometimes murdered for their life insurance money. One might fear speculators similarly selling a firm's stock short before directly damaging its capital or product, in order to profit from a stock price fall. This almost never happens because it's very hard to combine enough financial capital with a willingness and ability to sabotage

It's far harder to substantially damage national welfare. Furthermore, damaging actions should only favor market evaluations of a particular proposal if speculators expect that such damaging actions are more likely if the proposal is not implemented. Thus in order to bias a decision via sabotage, one has to commit to substantially harming national welfare if the decision goes one way, but not if the decision goes another way, and either have deep financial pockets to bet on this or credibly convince deep-pocket speculators that you had so committed. This is an unlikely scenario.

*13. Welfare Measurement Might Be Corrupted*

The straightforward way to profit from an ability to change a measurement would be to artificially raise or lower that measurement, after one had bet that this change would happen.

In order to bias a decision, one has to commit to substantially changing an important contribution to measured national welfare if a decision went one way, but not if a decision went another way, and either have very deep financial pockets or convince deep-pocket speculators that you had so committed, without revealing your corruption to enforcers. This seems unlikely.

*14. A Policy Might Influence How Welfare Is Measured*

If speculators expected a policy to raise estimates of national welfare by influencing how welfare is measured, rather than by influencing real welfare, they still would approve that policy.

It's therefore important that welfare measurement be a relatively independent process. Markets should not be allowed to approve proposals that substantially change how welfare is measured, or the political process that leads to changes in the welfare definition.

*15. Policies Might Be Encoded In The Welfare Definition*

Elected representatives could in principle directly get whatever decisions they wanted by encoding them in welfare definition. For example, if they wanted a certain road built, they might put a term in the welfare definition that takes on a large positive value if the road is built as specified, and zero otherwise. Speculators would then have to agree that building the road would raise expected national welfare.

To avoid this, courts might be empowered to enforce a rule against such rigged welfare definitions, just as courts now enforce the rule that tax laws cannot too directly  single out a particular person for higher taxes. More generally we might hope the public would consider such welfare terms as scandalous. At worst, this new form of government would just revert to our something like familiar democracy.

*16. Most Decisions Cannot Detectably Impact Welfare*

Speculative markets do not create infinitely precise prices, since many random contingencies influence exactly who trades what when. To avoid letting such contingencies overly influence policy, we can require markets to clearly favor a proposal over the status quo, via consistently higher prices over a substantial period. But then how could small changes ever be approved?

Many small changes added together can have large impact. For example, instead of proposing to build a particular stadium, one could propose a general policy saying how all stadium decisions will be made. Instead of proposing one road, one can suggest a general road policy.

A useful general approach is to let laws recurse, via derivative decision market regimes with more focused welfare measures. For example, a general stadium policy might be approved at a basic level which says to approve any proposed stadium if markets estimate that it would increase some measure of regional welfare, stadium profitability, or an ex post cost-benefit calculation. A stadium that would not noticeably affect national welfare may noticeably affect regional welfare.

*17. The Military Needs Secrecy, But Markets Are Public*

This form of government allows public decisions, but does not require them. The general rule of government could be used to approve a regime in which military decisions are made in private. That private regime could be private markets, where only certain people could see prices and trade, or it could be any other institution that speculators expect to produce good military police.

We would still allow ordinary speculators to override general military policy in any specific case where they estimate that doing so would substantially raise national welfare. In weighing the gain of such overrides, speculators would take into account the fact that such overrides would be public and therefore known to potential enemies.

*18. How Can We Set All Of These Parameters Well?*

There are many detailed questions about how exactly to implement this proposal. How can we ensure such parameters would be set well?

Legal recursion could robustly address these detail questions. See paper for more details.

*19. This Ignores The Cost of Considering Proposals*

If one always adopts proposals that would raise welfare conditional on adopting them, one ignores the cost of evaluating proposals. There are real costs for people to continually pay attention to new proposals, watching for ones that might threaten their interests. But when speculators estimate the benefits of a proposal conditional on adopting it versus not adopting it, they ignore this cost of evaluating the proposal, since this cost will have already been incurred either way.

If it were easy for anyone to create a market that proposed a policy change, more good changes might result, but we might lose overall from paying more attention to the proposal process.

While this argues for limits on the rate at which proposals are considered, it does not argue for any particular way to choose proposals.

*20. You Might Not Catch Buggy Decisions Quickly Enough*

If a bad decision were made due to bad info, then market decision advice should be reversed the moment speculators became aware of this fact, as they would have authority to reverse the bad decision. But what if a bad decision were instead due to a bug in the welfare function, that is, an unintended consequence of oversimplifying some aspect of our values?

To fix this kind of problem, the democratic part of this form of government would have to vote to change the welfare function. But this process might be too slow to avoid harm from bad decisions that are expensive to undo.

Since legislatures today can also make mistakes that they are slow to correct, it isn’t clear that this problem would be any worse than today. Even so, it could be addressed via the future-welfare market vetoes included in the reference proposal above. In it, even if markets clearly estimate that a proposal will increase welfare as it is defined today, that proposal is vetoed if other markets clearly estimate a reduction in welfare as it will be defined later, say in one year. So if someone then spotted a bug, they could bet that elected representatives would agree that it is a bug and fix it within one year. If speculators agreed, the proposal would not be implemented.

*21. This Is Too Big A Change All At Once*

This form of government sets up a rule for changing the status quo, but allows for any status quo and any rate of change. Thus a nation might keep its current political system and modify its constitution only to allow policy to change via speculative markets. Once a bill was passed declaring the first definition of welfare and the agencies responsible for measuring it, policy would change only as fast as speculators deemed appropriate for achieving welfare as so defined.

*22. How Could One Number Encode All Our Values?*

A national welfare function could be arbitrarily complex, and could refer to not just measured economic, business, entertainment, or environmental quantities, but also to any expressed opinions. For example, to reduce the sense of shame we might feel after a war, national welfare could refer to broad surveys on shame taken after a war, or to more detailed evaluations by random juries after the war.

Legislatures could build a welfare measure incrementally. They could start with, say, GDP, and then entertain proposals to change this measure. Those in favor of a change could point to choices, real or hypothetical, where the new definition seems to choose better than the current definition. Those opposed would then point to choices  where the old definition seems to choose better than the new. Representatives would then decide which errors seemed most tolerable.

*23. Easy to Measure Values Would Be Over-Valued*

A teacher who is rewarded only on the basis of student test scores may neglect aspects of teaching that do not much influence test scores. If other outcomes of teaching are important and hard to measure, it can be better to pay teachers a flat salary than to pay them only for outcomes that can be easily measured.

This new form of government could similarly cause harm if important things we valued did not contribute to national welfare as formally measured. And some things we value are certainly much harder to measure than others. The similarity with teachers ends there, however. It is risk-aversion, together with exerting hidden effort, that makes us reluctant to pay teachers on noisy measures of the real outcomes of interest. Market speculators, in contrast, are to a good approximation risk-neutral, and exert no relevant hidden effort when making estimates.

There is no good reason for a national welfare measure not to include every factor  that contributes substantially to real welfare, even if the best available measures of those factors are rather noisy. For example, we might care about the beauty and comfort of our city centers beyond how such things contribute to city land values or tourism revenue. So we might create many independent commissions to rank the beauty and comfort of city centers around the world, and include a median commission ranking in a city’s welfare measure.

*24. You Can Not Pay Off Bets If Earth Is Destroyed*

Any betting market implicitly gives estimates that are conditional on that market continuing to function and pay off bets. Betting markets cannot therefore directly estimate how a proposed policy would affect the chances all humans are destroyed, or any other event that would prevent paying off the bets. We do care, however, about how our policies might affect the chance of such events.

If this bias is big enough to bother with, we might augment national welfare to include official-panel-made estimates of the chances we have avoided so far of various types of destruction. Or we might more directly include in national welfare the average ticket prices for refuges, places where people might hope to survive an extreme disaster.

*25. Risk Premia Distort Estimates*

Average investment returns today vary with a few dimensions that are said to pay “risk premia." While in general asset prices should equal an expected value of future asset prices, averaging over different possible states of the world, states in which future returns are high are in effect given a lower weight than their probability would suggest. Ideally the definition of national welfare (and the base asset) would try to correct for this effect.
