## The need for a new foundation
---
- Thirty years earlier, in one of his celebrated "Theses on Feuerbach" (VI), Marx had written: "the human essence is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In its reality it is the ensemble of the social relations."
- It follows from this belief that if you can totally change the "ensemble of the social relations", you can totally change human nature. 
	- This claim goes to the heart of Marxism and of more broadly marxist thinking. As a result, it affects much of the thought of the entire left.
- The left needs a new paradigm. 
	- The collapse of communism and the abandonment by democratic socialist parties of the traditional socialist objective of national ownership of the means of production has deprived the left of the goals it cherished over the two centuries in which it formed and grew to a position of great political power and intellectual influence.
	- The trade union movement has been the powerhouse of the left in many countries. What capitalists failed to accomplish by a century of repressive measures against the trade union leaders, the World Trade Organization enthusiastically endorsed by social democratic governments around the world, is doing for them.
		- When barriers to imports are removed, nationally based trade unions are undermined. Now when workers in high wage countries demand better conditions, the bosses can threaten to close the factory and import the goods from China, where wages are low and trade unionists will not cause trouble.
		- The only way for unions to maintain their clout would be for them to organize internationally; but when the discrepancies between the living standards of workers are as great as they are today between, say, Europe and China, the common interests for doing so are lacking.
		- The interests of a German worker in keeping up the payments on a new car are not likely to elicit much sympathy from Chinese workers hoping to be able to afford adequate health care and education for their children
- The left is in need of new ideas and new approaches, Singer suggests an approach to human social, political, and economic behavior based firmly on a modern understanding of human nature.
- It's time to take seriously the fact we are evolved animals, and we bear the evidence of our inheritance in our anatomy, DNA, and behavior.
- It's time to develop a Darwinian left.

## What is essential to the left?
---
- Can the left swap Marx for Darwin, and still remain left?
	- To answer this we have to ask another question: What is essential to the left?
	- If we shrug our shoulders at the avoidable suffering of the weak and the poor, of those who are getting exploited and ripped off, or who simply do not have enough to sustain life at a decent level, we are not of the left.
	- If we say that that is just the way the world is, and always will be, and there is nothing we can do about it, we are not part of the left.
	- We should work towards a more equal distribution of resources because of the diminishing marginal utility of money.
- We can turn to the politics associated with Darwinism: Where has the left traditionally stood in regard to Darwinian thinking, and why?
