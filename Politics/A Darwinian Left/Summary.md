A Darwinian left would not:
- Deny the existence of a human nature, nor insist that human nature is inherently good, nor that it is infinitely malleable.
- Expect to end all conflict and strife between human beings, whether by political revolution, social change, or better education.
- Assume that all inequalities are due to discrimination, prejudice, oppression or social conditioning. Some will be, but this cannot be assumed in every case.

A Darwinian left would:
- Accept that there is such a thing as human nature, and seek to find out more about it, so that policies can be grounded on the best available evidence of what human beings are like.
- Reject any inference from what is 'natural' to what is 'right'.
- Expect that, under different social and economic systems, many people will act competitively in order to enhance their own status, gain a position of power, and/or advance their interests and those of their kin.
- Expect that, regardless of the social and economic system in which they live, most people will respond positively to genuine opportunities to enter into mutually beneficial forms of cooperation.
- Promote structures that foster cooperation rather than competition, and attempt to channel competition into socially desirable ends.
- Recognise that the way in which we exploit nonhuman animals is a legacy of a pre-Darwinian past that exaggerated the gulf between humans and other animals, and therefore work towards a higher moral status for nonhuman animals, and a less anthropocentric view of our dominance over nature.
- Stand by the traditional values of the left by being on the side of the weak, poor and oppressed, but think very carefully about what social and economic changes will really work to benefit them.
