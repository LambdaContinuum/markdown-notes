## The right-wing takeover
----
- Two months after the publication of *The Origin of Species*, Darwin wrote:
> I have received in a Manchester newspaper rather a good squib, showing that I have proved might is right and therefore that Napoleon is right, and every cheating tradesman is also right.

- The writer of the review may have been the first to suggest that Darwin's theory could be used as an ethical justification of the right of the strong to trample over the weak. He certainly wasn't the last
- Darwin himself rejected the idea that any ethical implications could be drawn from his work.
	- Nevertheless, evolution became a high fashion item among late nineteenth and early twentieth-century American capitalists.
	- These ideas did not all come from Darwin. Herbet Spencer, drawing ethical implications from evolution, provided the defends of laissez-faire capitalism with intellectual foundations that they used to oppose state interference with market forces.
	- Andrew Carnegie acknowledges that competition may sometimes be hard for the individual but justified it on the grounds that "it is best for the race, because it insures the survival of the fittest in every department".
	- John D. Rockefeller Jr wrote: "The growth of a large business is merely a survival of the fittest ...  The American Beauty rose can be produced in the splendor and fragrance which bring cheer to its beholder only by sacrificing the early buds which grow around it. This is not an evil tendency in business. It is merely the working out of a law of nature and a law of God"

## Facts and values
---
- Some versions of Social Darwinism fallaciously deduce values from facts.
- Because the theory of evolution is a scientific theory, and the gap between facts and values remains unbridgeable, we cannot conclude the direction of evolution is "good".
- Evolution carries no moral loading, it just happens. We are no more justified in helping it on its way than we are in doing our best to slow it down. Nor can we use our knowledge of evolution to discover "ethical premises inherent in man's biological nature" or deduce universal human rights from the fact we are mammals.
	- We may learn what makes human beings happy or sad, what leads them to develop their capacities for knowledge, wisdom, concern for others and a harmonious existence with their fellow creatures; but ethical premises will not be among these discoveries.
	- be among these discoveries. Even an evolved disposition like the disposition to repay favours one has received - cannot serve as the premise of an argument that tells us, without further ethical input, what we ought to do.
- The factâ€”value distinction could provide a short way of answering the question: can there be a Darwinian left? The answer would then be: since to be of the left is to hold certain values, Darwin's theory has nothing to do with whether one is left or right. So there can be a Darwinian left as easily as there can be a Darwinian right.
- That's not the end of the discussion, because not all those who have appealed to Darwin's ideas to defend a political view have attempted to deduce values from facts. Some of them have instead used the theory of evolution to argue that a particular course of action will have the best consequences, where by 'best consequences' they appeal to some widely shared values, such as greater happiness and prosperity for all, or surpassing the greatest achievements of previous civilizations.
- There are many different ways in which Darwinian thinking can be invoked in political debate, and some are more defensible than others. We have already seen the following three:
	1. **The idea that the direction of evolution itself is 'good' or 'right'.**
	- This can be rejected without further discussion
	2.  **The view that social policies may, by helping the 'less fit' to survive, have deleterious genetic consequences.**
	- This is highly speculative. The factual basis for such a claim is strongest in regard to the provision of life-saving medical treatment to people with genetically linked diseases that without treatment would kill their victims before they could reproduce. There is a huge gap between these cases of specific medical treatments for genetically influenced diseases, and the vague suggestions sometimes heard that providing financial support to people who are unemployed will make it possible for them to have children, and therefore lead to a greater representation of 'deleterious' genes in the population. Even if there were a genetic component to something as nebulous as unemployment, to say that these genes were 'deleterious* would involve value judgments that go way beyond what the science alone can tell us.
	3. **The assertion that an understanding of human nature in the light of evolutionary theory can help us to identify the means by which we may achieve some of our social and political goals, including various ideas of equality, as well as assessing the possible costs and benefits of doing so.**
	- This needs to be taken seriously, it does not suggest any social policy is wrong because it's contrary to Darwinian thinking. It leaves the ethical decision to us, merely offering to provided information relevant to that decision.
- Here, Singer adds a fourth way in which Darwinian thinking could be relevant to a political issue.:
	4.  **The debunking or discrediting of politically influential, non-Darwinian, beliefs and ideas.**
	- All pre-Darwinian political beliefs and ideas need to be examined to see if they contain factual elements that are incompatible with Darwinian thinking.
		- For example, Sir Robert Filmer's doctrine of the divine right of kings depended on the idea that Adam was given authority over his children, and that this authority was passed down through the eldest line of his descendants, until, in seventeenth-century England, it reached the House of Stuart. Since the theory of evolution suggests that there never was an original Adam, nor a Garden of Eden, Darwin has given us a basis for rejecting this view.
	- This may seem superfluous because, as John Locke pointed out three hundred years ago, there are several other grounds for dismissing Filmer's theory. But consider a different, but related view: that God gave Adam dominion over 'the fish of the sea, and the fowl of the air, and everything that moved upon the Earth'. That belief still seems to exercise some influence on our attitudes to nonhuman animals, though it is as thoroughly refuted by the theory of evolution as is the doctrine of the divine right of kings.
	- Darwin showed in great detail that there is a continuum between humans and animals, not only with respect to anatomy and physiology, but also with regard to their mental lives.
		- Animals, he showed, are capable of love, memory, curiosity, reason and sympathy for each other.
		- By knocking out the intellectual foundations of the idea that we are a separate creation from the animals, and utterly different in kind, Darwinian thinking provided the basis for a revolution in our attitudes to nonhuman animals. 
		- Sadly that revolution did not occur, and despite some recent progress, it still has not occurred. Darwinian political thinkers should be more inclined to recognise, and base policies on, the similarities we identify between humans and nonhuman animals.
	- If Darwinian thinking tells us that we have been too ready to assume a fundamental difference in kind between human beings and nonhuman animals, it could also tell us that we are too ready to assume that all human beings are the same in all important respects. While Darwinian thought has no impact on the priority we give to equality as a moral or political ideal, it gives us grounds for believing that since men and women play different roles in reproduction, they may also differ in their inclinations or temperaments, in ways that best promote the reproductive prospects of each sex. 
		- Since women are limited in the number of children they can have, they are likely to be selective in their choice of mate.
		- Men, on the other hand, are limited in the number of children they can have only by the number of women they can have sex with. If achieving high status increases access to women, then we can expect men to have a stronger drive for status than women.
		- This means that we cannot use the fact that there is a disproportionately large number of men in high status positions in business or politics as a reason for concluding that there has been discrimination against women. For example, the fact that there are fewer women chief executives of major corporations than men may be due to men being more willing to subordinate their personal lives and other interests to their career goals, and biological differences between men and women may be a factor in that greater readiness to sacrifice everything for the sake of getting to the top. (How is this an example of discrimination?)
-  The diverse ways in which Darwinian thinking can connect with ethics and politics mean that drawing a distinction between facts and values does not settle all the issues about the nature of a Darwinian left.
- There is a penumbra of factual beliefs that have typically been associated with the left. We need to ask whether these factual beliefs are at odds with Darwinian thinking and, if they are, what the left would be like without them.

## How the left got Darwin wrong
---
- The left's mistake in regard to Darwinian thinking has been to accept the assumptions of the right, starting with the idea that the Darwinian struggle for existence corresponds to the vision of nature suggested by Tennyson's memorable (and pre-Darwinian) phrase, 'nature red in tooth and claw'.
- We cannot blame the left for seeing the Darwinian struggle for existence in these ruthless terms. Until the 1960s evolutionary theorists themselves neglected the role that cooperation can play in improving an organism's prospects of survival and reproductive success.
- So the fact that nineteenth-century Darwinism was more congenial to the right than the left is due, at least in part, to the limitations of Darwinian thinking in that period.
- There was one great exception to the statement that the left accepted the 'nature red in tooth and claw' view of the struggle for existence.
	- Anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin argued in his book Mutual Aid that Darwinists (though not always Darwin himself) had overlooked cooperation between animals of the same species as a factor in evolution.
	- Nevertheless, he went astray in trying to explain exactly how mutual aid could work in evolution, since he did not see clearly that for a Darwinian there is a problem in assuming that individuals behave altruistically for the sake of a larger group.
		- Worse, for fifty years after Kropotkin wrote Mutual Aid, many highly respected evolutionary theorists made the same mistake.
	- Kropotkin drew on his study of the importance of cooperation in animals and humans to argue that human beings are naturally cooperative. The crime and violence we see in human societies, he argued, are the result of governments that entrench inequality. Human beings do not need governments and would cooperate more successfully without them. Though Kropotkin was widely read, his anarchist conclusions separated him from the main-stream left, including, the Marxists.
- Beginning with Marx himself, Marxists have generally been enthusiastic about Darwin's account of the origin of species, as long as its implications for human beings are confined to anatomy and physiology.
- Since the alternative to the theory of evolution was the Christian account of divine creation, Darwin's bold hypothesis was seized on as a means of breaking the hold of 'the opium of the masses'.
- In 1862 Marx wrote to the German socialist Ferdinand Lassalle that:
> Darwin's book is very important and serves me as a natural-scientific basis for the class struggle in history. One has to put up with the crude English method of development, of course. Despite all deficiencies, not only is the death-blow dealt here for the first time to *teleology* in the sciences, but its rational meaning is empirically explained . . .

- Yet Marx, consistent with his materialist theory of history, also thought that Darwin's work was itself the product of a bourgeois society:
> It is remarkable how Darwin recognises among beasts and plants his English society with its division of labour, competition, opening-up of new markets, 'inventions', and the Malthusian 'struggle for existence'.

- Engels was particularly enthusiastic about Darwin. In his speech at Marx's graveside, Engels paid Darwin the supreme compliment of comparing Marx's discovery of the law of human development with Darwin's discovery of 'the law of development of organic nature'.
- He even wrote a posthumously published essay entitled 'The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man', which attempts to blend Darwin and Marx.
	- The essay reveals, however, that for all his enthusiasm Engels had not understood Darwin properly: since he believed that acquired characteristics could be inherited by future generations, his mode of evolution is Lamarckian rather than Darwinian.
	- Decades later, Engels' naive support for the inheritance of acquired characteristics had tragic consequences when it was used by Soviet Lamarckians to show that their stand was consistent with Marxism and dialectical materialism.
	- This prepared the ground for the rise to favour, with Stalin's backing, of the pseudo-scientist T. D. Lysenko, who claimed to have made Soviet agriculture more productive by the use of Lamarckian ideas, and the dismissal, imprisonment and death of many of the leading geneticists of the Soviet Union. Under Lysenko's influence Soviet agronomy also went down the Lamarckian cul-de-sac, which certainly did not help the parlous state of Soviet agriculture.
- Serious as Engels* Lamarckian lapse was, it is less fundamental a flaw than his idea that what Darwin did for natural history, Marx did for human history.
- In that neat characterisation there lurks the notion that Darwinian evolution stops at the dawn of human history, and the materialist forces of history take over. That idea needs to be examined more closely.
- Here is Marx's classic statement of his materialist theory of history:
> The mode of production of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.

- By 'mode of production of material life' Marx meant the way in which people produce the goods that satisfy their needs - by hunting and gathering, by growing crops, by harnessing steam power to drive machines.
	- The mode of production, he argued, gives rise to a particular set of economic relationships, such as lord and serf, or capitalist and labourer, and this economic basis determines the legal and political superstructures of society, which form our consciousness.
	- The materialist theory of history implies that there is  no fixed human nature. It changes with every change in the mode of production. Human nature has already changed in the past â€” between primitive communism and feudalism, for example, or between feudalism and capitalism â€” and it can change again in the future. In less precise form this idea goes back long before Marx. In his Discourse on the Origin of Inequality, Rousseau dramatically presented the idea that the inauguration of private property changed everything.
	- To anyone who sees a continuity between human beings and our nonhuman ancestors, it seems implausible that Darwinism gives us the laws of evolution for natural history but stops at the dawn of human history.
	- In his  Dialectics of Nature, Engels wrote: "The most that the animal can achieve is to collect; man produces, he prepares the means of life in the widest sense of the words, which, without him, nature would not have produced. This makes impossible any immediate transference of the laws of life in animal societies to human ones."
	- The distinction Engels draws between humans and animals is dubious - fungus-growing ants, for example, grow and eat specialised fungi that would not have existed without their activity. But, even if it were valid, why should the difference between collecting and producing be so important as to suspend the laws of evolution? Why would productive capacities not also be susceptible to evolutionary pressures? Engels leaves these questions unanswered.

## The dream of perfectibility
---
- Belief in the malleability of human nature has been important for the left because it has provided grounds for hoping that a very different kind of human society is possible.
- Singer suspects this is the ultimate reason why the left rejected Darwinian thought.
- It dashed the left's Great Dream: The Perfectibility of Man.
- For as long as the left has existed, it has sought a society in which all human beings live harmoniously and cooperatively with each other in peace and freedom.
- it was not surprising that Marx objected to Darwin reading 'the Malthusian "struggle for existence"' into nature.
- From the start, Marx and Engels recognised the opposition between their own views and the theory of population put forward by Thomas Malthus. The very first work that either of them wrote on economics, Engels' 1844 essay 'Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy', includes a rebuttal of Malthus. In the same year Marx
- In contrast, Marx and Engels themselves saw poverty as the result of particular economic systems rather than as an inevitable consequence of the workings of nature. 
- Malthus was easy enough to refute, for he offered no good grounds for his assumption that, while population increases geometrically, the food supply can increase only arithmetically
- Darwin's theory of evolution, however, was a different matter, and neither Marx nor Engels wished to reject it as a whole. Nevertheless, if the theory of evolution applied to human history in so far as humans are evolved beings, as well as to natural history, the antagonisms and conflicts that Marx saw communism as resolving  would never be fully resolved.
- For Darwin the struggle for existence, or at least for the existence of one's offspring, is unending.This is a long way from the dream of perfecting mankind.
- If, on the other hand, the materialist theory of history is correct, and social existence determines consciousness, then the greed, egoism, personal ambition and envy that a Darwinian might see as inevitable aspects of our nature can instead be seen as the consequence of living in a society with private property and private ownership of the means of production.
	- Without these particular social arrangements, people would no longer be so concerned about their private interests. Their nature would change and they would find their happiness in working cooperatively with others for the communal good. That is how communism would overcome the antagonism between man and man. The riddle of history can be solved only if this antagonism is a product of the economic basis of our society, rather than an inherent aspect of our biological nature
- Hence the resolute determination of many on the left to keep Darwinian thinking out of the social arena.
- Plekhanov, the leading nineteenth-century Russian Marxist, followed Engels in holding that 'Marx's inquiry begins precisely where Darwin's inquiry ends', and this became the conventional wisdom of Marxism.
- Lenin said that 'the transfer of biological concepts into the field of the social sciences is a meaningless phrase.
- Lysenko went further in revising Darwinian thinking. He rejected the idea of competition within species even in nature.

## Old tunes keep coming back
---
- The conflict between the Marxist theory of history and a biological view of human nature has continued into the late twentieth century.
	- There have been exceptions, most notably J. B. S. Haldane, a major contributor to the development of modern Darwinism and at the same time a communist who did not shy away from acknowledging the influence of evolution and heredity on human affairs.
