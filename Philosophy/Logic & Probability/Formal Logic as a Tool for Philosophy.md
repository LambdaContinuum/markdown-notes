Formal philosophy began with logic, and logic is still its dominating formal language

## *The Origins of Logic*
---
[[Basic overview of logic|Logic]] is concerned with how we draw conclusions. Its systematic study begins with the observation that some inferences fall into general patterns. Such patterns are characterized by being insensitive to the meaning of certain elements of that which we say or think.

Following Leibniz, we can use the term "formal arguments" for arguments in which "the form of reasoning has been demonstrated in advance so that one is sure of not going wrong with it".

Note the argument:
1. Rich men are condescending.
2. *Therefore*: Non-condescending men are not rich.

The argument from has one premise and one conclusion. In Aristotle's logic, such arguments are called conversion rules. However, the major focus in Aristotelian logic was on arguments with two premises and one conclusion, called syllogisms. Consider the following:

1. All logicians are philosophers
2. Some logicians are cacographers
3. *Therefore*: some philosophers are cacographers

The validity of this syllogism is not disturbed by the vagueness of the terms "logician" and "philosopher", and you need not know what a cacographer is to confirm its validity.

Archimedes is reported to have said "Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth". For a lever to work properly, we need a rigid and reliable pivot. Similarly in logic, in order for some terms, namely the variables, to be flexible in meaning and exchangeable, we need other terms that provide a rigid and immutable platform on which the movements and exchanges of variables take place.

These terms that have this function are called *logical constants*. In the above examples, "all", "some", and "not" have the role of logical constants. Syllogistic logic, which held sway from Aristotle's time until the late nineteenth century, was devoted to these three logical constants and argument forms that could be constructed with them. But there were also three parallel traditions in logic that employed other constants.

One of these was sentential logic, the logic of sentences, first developed by Chrysippus and other Stoics. In sentential logic, the variables are sentences or propositions, rather than parts of sentences as in syllogistic logic.

Chrysippus identified proposition as "that which is capable of being denied or affirmed as it is in itself". The logical constants are words like "and", "or", "if", and "not". An argument in sentential logic can be as follows:

1. Either I laugh or you cry.
2. I do not laugh.
3. *Therefore*: you cry.

Sentential logic lived a marginal existence in the shadow of syllogistic logic but gained in importance through the work of George Boole and others in the nineteenth century.

The second of these traditions was modal logic, the logic of necessity, possibility, and related concepts. Its two most important logical constants are "necessarily" and "possibly". The oldest texts on modal logic are by Aristotle himself. Just like sentential logic, modal logic was overshadowed by standard syllogistic logic. It was revived in the early twentieth century by C.I. Lewis.

The third tradition is somewhat more difficult to pinpoint. It has its origin in what Aristotle called the *topoi*, or topics. These were valid arguments in which the role of logical constants was played by a wider range of concepts. These include "good", "better", and "child". Studies of the topics continued through the ages, although usually with somewhat less precision than in the dominant logical pursuits. The importance of such argumentation was emphasized by Leibniz when he wrote:
> "It should also be realized that there are valid non-syllogistic inferences which cannot be rigorously demonstrated in any syllogism unless the terms are changed a little, and this altering of the terms is the non-syllogistic inference. There are several of these, including arguments from the direct to the oblique − e.g. ‘If Jesus Christ is God, then the mother of Jesus Christ is the mother of God’. And again, the argument-form which some good logicians have called relation-conversion, as illustrated by the inference: ‘If David is the father of Solomon, then certainly Solomon is the son of David."

## *The "Newtonian" Revolution in Logic*
---
These traditions in logic had one important limitation in common: They were devoted to single argumentative steps. Actual argumentation usually proceeds by a whole series of steps. This restriction to single steps, taken on eat a time, turns out to be a serious limitation since some arguments cannot be fully understood unless on takes a more comprehensive approach.

For example, in his *Elements* Euclid would often introduce an assumption only in order to refute it. After making the assumption he presented a multi-step argument based on it. Many steps later he arrived at an inconsistent conclusion, based on which he inferred that the assumption was false. This is a type of argument logicians had great difficulties in accounting for since they dealt with each step separately.

In the middle of the nineteenth century, logic was still a c. We can compare its status to that of mechanics two hundred years earlier. Before Isaac Newton's *Principia* there were two branches of mechanics:
1. Terrestrial mechanics that dealt with the movements of objects on earth
2. Celestial mechanics that dealt with the movements of the heavenly bodied.

Newton managed to unite the two disciplines by providing a mathematical model that was sufficiently general to cover the movements of both earthly and heavenly bodies. His new framework covered not only single events, but also complex interactions among a large number of objects, such as the bodies of the solar system.

In 1879, Frege published his *Begriffsschrift* which did to logic what the *Principa* had done to mechanics. Frege's major invention was a notation (*quantifiers*) that could express the logical constants "all" and "some" in a much more versatile manner, and made them easily combinable with sentential constants such as "and" and "or". His new framework was a [[Predicate Logic|general logical calculus]] lacking the limitation to small steps that was inherent in the Aristotelian system of syllogisms. Instead of considering just two premises it was now possible to consider any set of premises, however large. 

This made it possible to ask questions that did not even arise in the logic of syllogisms. For any given set of premises, one could ask whether a particular conclusion follows from it. Sometimes that question could be answered affirmatively by providing a step by step proof. In other cases, it could be answered negatively by showing no combination of valid argumentative steps can lead to the conclusion.

With Frege, logic took the giant leap from an atomistic study of the smallest parts of the arguments to a holistic analysis of what can and cannot be inferred from given premises.

Frege's system was limited to the logical constants that had been studied for more than two millennia in syllogistic and sentential logic: "all", "some", "not", "and", "or", "if", and "if and only if". Enough to cover a large part of mathematical reasoning, but still not enough for philosophical argumentation.

In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, philosophical logicians fully realized this, and developed logical systems in which the role of logical constants is played by terms representing a wide variety of notions such as "[[Necessity and Possibility|necessary]]", "possible", "know", "believe, "[[Deontic Logic|permit]]", "good", etc.

Many of these had been studied in previous centuries as part of the modal or the topics tradition. After Frege, they could be included in holistic systems of argumentation, rather than being used in rules referring to a single, isolated step of reasoning.

## *The Actual Truth or a Model of the Truth?*
---
The achievements of Frege's system of logic inspired many philosophers, and some believed that logical analysis could now replace other uncertain methods used by philosophers.

Russell maintained: 
> "every philosophical problem, when it is subjected to the necessary analysis and purification, is found either to be not really philosophical at all, or else to be, in the sense in which we are using the word, logical".

He and many others believed logic would make it possible to reach a more fundamental level of philosophical insight, resolving philosophical problems that could not be solved in natural language due to its lack of precision.

It was discovered that philosophers can disagree about a problem expressed in logical terms just as they can disagree about one expressed in natural language.  Russell's own analysis of definite descriptions provides a clear example of this.

Consider the example: "The king of France is wise". According to Russell, this should be interpreted as follows: $\exists x(Kx \land (\forall y)(Ky \to x = y) \land Wx)$

On such an analysis the sentence is false. Strawson criticizes Russell's account, saying the question expressed no statement at all, and so the question of whether it's true or false doesn't raise at all.

Merely translating a philosophical problem into logical language cannot be expected to solve it. Philosophical dispute can continue, now referring to the logical formulation.

## *A Guarded Defense of Formalization*
---
The rise of modern symbolic logic can be seen as part of a more general, long-term, trend: More and more scientific and scholarly disciplines have become dependent on mathematical modelling. 

Astronomy is the only empirical branch of learning that has been thoroughly mathematized ever since antiquity. Physics became gradually more and more mathematized from the late Middle Ages onwards, and chemistry since the late eighteenth century.

The great rush came in the twentieth century, when discipline after discipline adopted mathematical methods. The best example is economics, which has gone from almost no use of mathematics to being dominated by theories expressed in mathematical language. In the last few decades, formal models, in particular game theory, have had a strong and increasing influence throughout the social sciences. At the same time, the mathematization of the natural sciences has accelerated. Large parts of biology and the earth sciences, such as ecology, population genetics, and climatology are thoroughly mathematized.

Mathematical tools were adopted in these areas is because they proved efficient; they improved the predictive and explanatory capacities of the disciplines in question. The increased role of formal methods in philosophy have a similar explanation: we have introduced formal tools in order to express problems more precisely and obtain solutions in new ways. There is a caveat: The usefulness of formal tools is not quite as overwhelming
in philosophy as in the empirical disciplines.

We usually think mathematical physics began with Galileo, but mathematical methods were used in physics already in the fourteenth century. Medieval physicists (the calculatores) developed mathematical models of physical phenomena, proceeding in much the same way as Euclidean geometers.

A geometer used “pure thought” to determine the laws that govern lines, surfaces, and three-dimensional bodies. In much the same way, physicists used their intuition when attempting to find the laws that govern the movement of bodies. And importantly, intuition had a double role: Not only was the development of these mathematical models guided by intuition, it was also against intuition that they were tested. This was before the great revolution in physics led by Galileo. 

Although Galileo used his intuition as a starting-point when developing mathematical models of physical phenomena, he went on to test these models against experiments and exact observations. Since our mechanical intuitions are rather consistently wrong, this reality check was necessary to correct errors in the previous models.

This is the standard approach to mathematical models in the empirical sciences today. Models are tested against measurements whose values are expected to correspond to the variables of these models. This can only be done if accurate measurement methods are in place. Before the thermometer was invented, physicists had no better means to assess theories about heat than to compare them with everyday experiences of heat and cold.

Exact measurement of temperature was a necessary condition for developing accurate mathematical theories of heat (thermodynamics). This is the general pattern in science. Measurement is our bridge between theories and observations. Mathematics is the medium in which we can transport information across that bridge, a medium unsurpassed in its information-carrying capacity..

Physics had access to the mathematical medium long before it learnt how to avail itself of the bridge. Unfortunately, philosophy is in a situation comparable to that of pre-Galilean physics: we have the mathematical medium, but we do not have the bridge of measurement. And this is not a deficiency that can easily be mended within the confines of philosophy as we conceive it today. Philosophers studying concepts such as knowledge, truth, goodness, and permission are operating with constructs of the human mind that do not necessarily have exact empirical correlates. Our situation can to some extent be compared to that of mathematicians, who have all of their foundations on the theoretical side.

Their research can improve the theories that are used in empirical work, but the information received back from empirical investigations does not normally lead to corrections of the mathematics. Similarly, philosophy can sometimes be used to improve theories in other disciplines, and the exactness of formal philosophy is often needed to match the precision required in these disciplines. But at least in most philosophical subject areas, empirical observations cannot support or disprove a theoretical statement in the same clear-cut way as in the empirical sciences.

Therefore, the claims that can be made for formalization are weaker in philosophy than in the natural and social sciences. In philosophy, the major virtue of formalization is the same as that of idealization in informal languages: By isolating important aspects it helps to bring them to light. In philosophical discussions we usually deviate from the general-language meanings of key terms such as “knowledge” or “value”, giving them meanings that are more streamlined and more accessible to exact definition. This does not necessarily mean that we have access to a true philosophical meaning that these concepts should be adjusted to. A much more credible justification is that such simplifications are necessary in order to obtain the precision needed for philosophical analysis.

We have to deviate from general language in order to make a sufficiently precise analysis. But if we deviate so far as to lose contact with general-language meanings, then the rationale for the whole undertaking may well be lost. This precarious situation applies, of course, to formal and informal philosophy alike.

All this boils down to a rather guarded defence of formalization in philosophy. It is a language in which we can build more precise models of philosophical subject matter, and as we will see, there are philosophical topics for which this increased precision is indispensable. However, formalization is no panacea. Mistaken ideas can be as easily formalized as valid ones. But although formalization is no safe road to philosophical truth, it is one of the best tools that we have for expressing, criticizing, and improving philosophical standpoints. It is an obvious but important corollary of this line of defense that we should not expect to find a uniquely “correct” formal analysis of philosophical subject matter. Different formalizations may capture different properties of our concepts.
