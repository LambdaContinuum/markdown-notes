# 1. Radical Skepticism and the Underdetermination Principle
---
Note that the rational support provided by our perceptual experiences do not seem to epistemically favor our ordinary perceptual beliefs over the kind of scenario's depicted by radical skeptical hypotheses.

One's rational support for a perceptual belief is *underdetermined* with respect to radical skeptical scenarios.

Using the quotidian proposition "E" as representative of an epistemically "best case" of perceptual belief:

>[!thesis] $(S_31)$ One cannot have rational support that favors one's belief that E over the BIV hypothesis.

This seems undeniable given the experiences had by a subject in the BIV case are indistinguishable from everyday experience, how is one to come by rational support for an everyday perceptual belief that epistemically favors this belief over an incompatible radical skeptical alternative. 

As with the [[Radical Skepticism and Closure|closure-based formulation]] of the skeptical paradox,  we need to show this sort of claim is in tension with our everyday knowledge. 

> [!thesis] $(S_33)$ One knows that E.

The skeptic needs a linking premise:

> [!thesis] $(S_32)$ If one cannot have rational support that favors one's belief that E over the BIV hypothesis, then one does not know that E.

How is this premise motivated? The answer lies in the skeptical appeal to a general epistemic principle which underwrites $(S_32)$.

> [!thesis] The Underdetermination Principle
> If $S$ knows that $p$ and $q$ describe incompatible scenarios, and yet $S$ lacks rational basis that favors $p$ over $q$, then $S$ lacks knowledge that $p$.

Note that the "incompatibility" in play only requires that they cannot both be true, not that there is a contradiction.

This principle takes it as given that knowledge, perceptual knowledge anyways, demands a solid rational foundation such that if this is lacking, then the subject lacks knowledge.

If perceptual knowledge lacks a solid rational foundation, then in virtue of what does it count as knowledge? 

Anyways with the underdetermination principle in play, the logical tension is clear.

>[!thesis] The Radical Skeptical Paradox (3)
> $(S_31)$ One cannot have rational support that favors one's belief that E over the BIV hypothesis.
> $(S_32)$ If one cannot have rational support that favors one's belief that E over the BIV hypothesis, then one does not know that E.
> $(S_33)$ One knows that E.

We've determined the following three claims to be inconsistent:

>[!thesis] The Inconsistent Radical Skeptical Triad\*\*
> 1.  One cannot have rational support that favors one's belief in an everyday proposition over an incompatible radical skeptical hypothesis.
> 2. The underdetermination principle.
> 3. One has widespread everyday knowledge.

# 2. An Overriding Anti-skeptical Strategy: Epistemic Externalism
---
An obvious response is to motivate rejection of the epistemic link that makes up the paradox. Similar to the closure-based formulation, we can appeal to a crude epistemic externalism.

Don't want to write it down, it's basically the same dilemma as the closure-based formulation. Here's the version of the underdetermination principle which makes it explicit that it concerns only rationally grounded knowledge.

> [!thesis] The $\text{Underdetermination}_{RK}$ Principle
> If $S$ knows that $p$ and $q$ describe incompatible scenarios, and yet $S$ lacks rational basis that favors $p$ over $q$, then $S$ lacks rationally grounded knowledge that $p$.

This formulation of the underdetermination principle will be equivalent to the previous formulation for the epistemic internalist.

>[!thesis] The Radical Skeptical Paradox (4)
> $(S_41)$ One cannot have rational support that favors one's belief that E over the BIV hypothesis.
> $(S_42)$ If cannot have rational support that favors one's belief that E over the BIV hypothesis, then one does not have rationally grounded knowledge that E.
> $(S_43)$ One has rationally grounded knowledge that E.

Look its basically the exact same response to the closure formulation you get the idea.

If the epistemic externalist takes the horn of rejecting $(S_43)$, knowledge comes radically apart from the possession of reasons such that our knowledge is generally, if not universally, lacking in rational support.

# 3. Attributer Contextualism as an Overriding Anti-skeptical Strategy
---
One of the most influential treatments of the problem of radical skepticism has been offered by attributer contextualism.

According to this proposal, "knows", is a context-sensitive term, such that the truth value of an assertion of a sentence of the form "S knows that p", call this a *knowledge ascription sentence*, can be dependent upon which conversational context the sentence is uttered (i.e. the context of the *attributer*).

More precisely, the kind of attributer contextualism that concerns us posits that "knows" can pick out more or less demanding epistemic standards in different conversational contexts. Thus, in a conversational context that incorporates a demanding epistemic standard for "knows", someone could assert a knowledge ascription sentence and thereby speak falsely, even though, in a different conversational context the assertion of this same ascription sentence could express a truth.

When the skeptic denies that we have knowledge she speaks truly, but only because her assertions of the negated form of the knowledge ascription sentences are made relative to a conservation context that employs a very demanding epistemic standard.

In normal conversational contexts where radical skeptical considerations are not at issue, subjects assert the corresponding knowledge ascription sentences they speak truly. The two camps are effectively talking past one another.

There are precedents for this kind of phenomenon in our ordinary language. Whether something counts as "tall", "short", "flat", and so on can be determined by conversational context. 

This is weird though, the claim at issue when one says one is unable to know the denials of radical skeptical hypotheses isn't that we have a weak epistemic base but not strong enough for knowledge, but rather that we have no epistemic basis at all.

(I'll ask Daron and Ethan about this)

# 4. Attributer Contextualism as an Undercutting Anti-skeptical strategy
---
The diachronic nature of our competent closure principle means that knowledge of the antecedent proposition must be preserved throughout the competent deduction.

This is important when evaluating attributer contextualism as an anti-skeptical strategy. 

Wait is he not making a bad point? Since we're actively considering the radical skeptical hypothesis when undertaking a competent deduction from everyday knowledge to the denial of radical skeptical hypothesis it means higher epistemic standards apply? Why can't we consider the radical skeptical hypothesis in a lower epistemic context. 

Why cant we evaluate a conditional where the antecedent is indexed to a different context as the consequent?

Ok nvm I don't really understand the previous point but I guess he's saying that we can retain 1 because when we consider skeptical hypothesis we are in the skeptical context and so 1 is true since we don't know in this context. 2 is true and 3 is true because they hold in there relevant epistemic contexts.

This way concedes to the skeptic, radical skepticism is correct in the context of epistemic appraisal in which the problem is posed. The attributer contextualist "resolution" of the radical skeptical problem effectively involves conceding.

It's no wonder that we get taken in by this problem, since whenever we consider it we are thereby in a context of epistemic appraisal in which the skeptic’s assertions are true. If the attributer contextualist is right, then the trick is simply to realize that this is only so relative to this specific context of epistemic appraisal. As Keith DeRose (1995, 42) has put the point, once “the conversational air has cleared” and one returns to a normal context of epistemic appraisal that employs quotidian epistemic standards, then assertions of knowledge ascription sentences will tend to express truths once more.

If this difficulty simply trades on such a straightforward semantic point why has the philosophical problem gripped us for so long? Note there is no parallel difficulty regarding the context sensitivity of supposed analogous terms like "tall".

No one is remotely puzzled by the fact that someone can be considered tall in a normal conversational context and yet not be considered tall relative to a specialized conversational context in which higher standards for tallness are operative. So why has a radical skeptical problem arisen regarding our use of “knows”? Are we radically mistaken about the usage of this everyday term? As a number of commentators have noted, attributer contextualism seems to attribute a degree of semantic blindness to subjects that is independently suspect.

Another problem for this response concerns how it endorses an epistemic hierarchy of contexts. The attributer contextualist concedes that the radical skeptic is employing more demanding epistemic standards for "knows" than are operative in everyday contexts of epistemic appraisal. Doesn't this cede the high ground to the radical skeptic? If we think of the skeptical problem as a putative paradox that arises out of conflict in our fundamental epistemic commitments, attributer contextualism seems to say that if we follow through on our basic epistemic commitments then the paradox will disappear  because radical skepticism, qua position, will be correct. The only protection against this is to avoid the radical skeptical context. This doesn't seem philosophically satisfying.

Pritchard wants to argue that any plausibility that radical skepticism has disappears once we try to apply it to underdetermination-based radical skepticism.

He asks, in virtue of what one possesses rationally grounded knowledge of everyday propositions given that one lacks a rational basis for ruling out radical skeptical hypothesis?

The epistemic context is just going be the base of propositions one holds. I guess one could ask by what means does one decide that one has a base of propositions.

I should come back and read this section.

## 5. Comparing the Two Forms of Radical Skepticism
---
>[!thesis] The Simplified Closure_RK-Based Entailment
>If $S$ has rationally grounded knowledge that $E$, then $S$ has rationally grounded knowledge that she is not a BIV.

>[!thesis] The Simplified Underdetermination_RK-Based Entailment
>If $S$ has rationally grounded knowledge that $E$, then $S$'s rational support favors her belief that $E$ over the BIV hypothesis.

Whereas the closure principle demands that one has rationally grounded knowledge that one is not a BIV, the simplified underdetermination principle merely demands that one has a rational basis that favors the target everyday proposition over the BIV alternative.

The former claim is much more demanding than the latter, in that one can have better reasons for thinking that one is seated at one's desk rather than that one is a BIV without thereby possessing rationally grounded knowledge that one is not a BIV.

Having better reason to believe that one is seated at one’s desk as opposed to being a disembodied BIV plausibly entails that one has some reason for believing that one is not a BIV, but it would be a stretch to maintain that this by itself entails that one has rationally grounded knowledge that one is not a BIV.

> (P1) $S$ has rationally grounded knowledge that $E$. \[Premise\]
> (P2) $S$ has rationally grounded knowledge that she is not a BIV \[From (P1), Simplified Closure_RK-Based Entailment\]
> (P3) $S$'s rational support favors her belief that $E$ over BIV hypothesis \[From (P1), (P2)\]

Since (P3) is the consequent of the simplified underdetermination-based entailment  and we can derive this from the common antecedent of the simplified underdetermination-based entailment and the closure-based entailment by appealing only to the closure principle, it follows that the closure principle entails the underdetermination principle.

Since there is no obvious analogous entailment for the simplified underdetermination-based principle, it follows that the closure principle is logically stronger than the underdetermination principle, in the sense that the former entails, but is not entailed by the latter.

All that follows from this is that a rejection of the underdetermination principle entails a rejection of the closure based principle. Hence, any response to the underdetermination based skeptical problem would thereby be a response to the closure-based skeptical problem.

# 6. The Source of Underdetermination-Based Radical Skepticism.
---
- The Rational Ground Principle asserts that if someone has a rationally grounded belief in a proposition (p), they cannot have a rational basis for believing the negation of that proposition (not-p).
- The Rational Ground* Principle extends this idea to any proposition (q) that is known to be incompatible with the believed proposition (p).
- Both principles ensure that rational support for a belief in a proposition outweighs any rational support for its negation or incompatible propositions.
- These principles are contrasted with the UnderdeterminationRK and ClosureRK principles, which address the logical relationship between knowledge and skeptical scenarios.
- The Rational Ground* Principle implies that if one knows a proposition (E) is true, they cannot rationally believe in a contradictory skeptical hypothesis (e.g., being a brain in a vat (BIV)).
- The principles are logically equivalent, meaning they entail each other, but the Rational Ground* Principle is conceptually more fundamental.
- Despite their logical equivalence, the Rational Ground* Principle is seen as more epistemologically basic and conceptually fundamental.
- This logical equivalence highlights the minimal requirements needed to support radical skepticism, showing that rejecting the UnderdeterminationRK principle alone may not effectively resolve the skeptical problem.

# 7. Two Sources of Radical Skepticism
---
Consider closure-based radical skepticism:
- This form of skepticism exposes the apparent skeptical consequences of what we might naturally refer to as the "universality"of rational evaluation, where this concerns the manner in which there is no *in principle* constraints on the extent of one's rational evaluations. Call this the *universality of rational evaluation thesis*.
- Such an idea seems to underline closure-based radical skepticism in virtue of how there seems no inherent problem with the idea of extending the scope of rational evaluation indefinitely by undertaking competent deductions from one's current stock of rationally grounded knowledge.
- In this way, one moves from rational evaluations of one’s everyday rational beliefs to a rational evaluation of one’s anti-skeptical commitments. In so doing, one is in effect shifting from a local rational evaluation to a global one, where the latter involves a wholesale rational assessment of one’s epistemic situation. That such a shift in epistemic focus is thought harmless reflects an implicit commitment to the universality of rational evaluation thesis, since without this in play we would not be so inclined to allow such closure-based inferences.

In contrast, consider underdetermination-based radical skepticism:
- Concerned with how the rational support we have for our perceptual beliefs about the external world, even in the best case, is weak, in that it is compatible with widespread falsity in those beliefs.
- Underdetermination-based radical skepticism exposes the insularity of our rational support for these beliefs. Call this claim the *insularity of reasons thesis*.

Whereas the universality of rational evaluation thesis is concerned with the lack of in principle constraints on rational evaluation, the insularity of reasons thesis is concerned with a certain limitation on rational support itself, at least as regards the rational support enjoyed by our perceptual beliefs.

That the rational support we have for our perceptual beliefs is insular in this way is often taken to be a core epistemological datum that requires explanation.

This can be summarized as the claim that the rational support we have for our perceptual beliefs even in optimal perceptual conditions can be no better than the rational support our envatted counterpart (whose experiences are indistinguishable from our own) has for her equivalent beliefs, even though her beliefs are of course radically false.

Although the ultimate skeptical import of the universality of rational evaluation thesis and the insularity of reasons thesis is the same, it is important to note that they pose distinct epistemological challenges.

Suppose, for example, that one rejected the universality of rational evaluation thesis and therefore argued that there are in principle limitations on the scope of rational evaluation. In this way, one could argue that closureRK-based inferences need to be restricted in some way to prevent them from taking the subject from local to global rational evaluations. One could thus undermine the closureRK-based radical skeptical paradox.

It is far from obvious how that would help one resolve the problem posed by the insularity of reasons thesis, however. That one can have rationally grounded knowledge of mundane external world propositions while lacking rationally grounded knowledge of the denials of radical skeptical hypotheses is one thing; that one can have adequately rationally grounded knowledge of mundane external world propositions when that rational basis (one is aware) does not favor one’s everyday beliefs over skeptical alternatives quite another.

Even with the closureRK principle out of (skeptical) action, one can still employ the underdeterminationRK principle—and, thereby, the insularity of reasons thesis—to motivate a radical skeptical conclusion. The same is true in the other logical direction.

A fully adequate response to the problem of radical skepticism may well need to be sensitive to the particular challenges posed by _both_ of the articulations of this problem that we have examined.

# 8. Anti-skeptical Desiderata
---
- Minimal requirement is that it should reject at least one of the claims that are generating the radical skeptical paradox.
- Showing at least one claim in each logically distinct articular of the paradox that is false.
- Ideally we would like the response to be undercutting rather than overriding. We should prefer a response to the problem that demonstrated that it was not the paradox that it purported to be, but rather rested on contentious theoretical claims that were being illictly presented as ungarnished intuition.
- We want to show that we are not rationally on par with our envatted counterparts as the insularity of reasons thesis suggests, but in fact are in possession of better rational support for our beliefs.
- Trick here is to show that the rejection of the insularity of reasons thesis is in keeping with our ordinary epistemic practices and hence not in conflict with intuition but merely reflects misguided philosophical theory.
- Ideally what we want from a response to the closure-based skeptical paradox is a way of retaining the closure principle while not endorsing the idea that we are able to know the denials of skeptical hypotheses, even though in line with our ideal response to the underdetermination-based skeptical paradox we do have better grounds for our everyday beliefs than skeptical alternatives.
- We are attempting a principled rejection of the universality of rational evaluation thesis while somehow keeping the truth of the closure principle intact.
- Finally, ideally we would have an integrated treatment, so that the responses to the distinct formulations are not only compatible, but mutually supporting.
