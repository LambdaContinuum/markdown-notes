 # Introductory Remarks
---
In [[Radical Skepticism and Closure]] and in [[Radical Skepticism and Underdetermination]] we saw that contemporary radical skeptical problem has two main aspects, one that turns on a closure style epistemic principle and one that turns on a underdetermination style epistemic principle.

Here, we'll consider the import of Wittgenstein's treatment of radical skepticism. Particularly, we will examine how best to construe this treatment in light of the distinction between the two ways of thinking about radical skepticism.

Wittgenstein offers us an undercutting anti-skeptical strategy, one that presents us with a direct response to the closure_rk-based radical skeptical problem

Wittgenstein urges upon us a principled rejection of the universality of rational evaluation thesis that we see is underpinning the skeptical employment of the closure_rk principle. We will be arguing that, properly construed, Wittgenstein's anti-skepticism offers us a way of rejecting the universality of rational evaluation thesis that is entirely consistent with endorsing the closure_rk principle.

We will also offer a diagnosis of why this approach may be unsatisfying in terms of its failure to properly engage with the underdetermination_rk-based formulation of the radical skeptical paradox, and thus with the insularity of reasons thesis which underlies this particular formulation of the paradox.

# Wittgenstein on the Structure of Rational Evaluation
----
The primary target of *On Certainty* is G. E. Moore's famous argument against skepticism. Moore's responded to the skeptical challenge by enumerating some of the many things that he took himself to be most certain of, and thus that he took himself to know.

These Moorean claims were meant to be such that if Moore knew anything, then he knew such propositions. Call these claims *Moorean certainties*. The most famous Moorean certainty is the claim that one has two hands. Such Moorean certainties are meant to play a kind of foundational epistemic role, in the sense that in virtue of being optimally certain they can be employed as the epistemic basis from which Moore can extract more controversial and less certain claims. As Moore points out, if one does know that one has two hands, then it surely follows that one can know that there is an external world (hands being, after all, physical items that occupy such an external world). Wittgenstein grants Moore this conditional claim in *On Certainty*: 

> If you do know that here is one hand, we'll grant you all the rest.

That the structure of rational evaluation should be though of along foundational lines is nothing new. Normally though, the items that serve the foundational role, typically beliefs but not necessarily, tended to be broadly philosophical in nature, in the sense that it took a certain kind of philosophical project, such as the Cartesian project of pure inquiry, to uncover them.

Moore's proposal, in contrast, is that he wanted to treat what he regarded as perfectly "everyday" certainties as being able to perform this foundational role.

Wittgenstein argues that there is something problematic about Moore's proposal. Moore's idea is that the certainties he cites can play this foundational epistemic role because, due to their optimal certainty, they possess a kind of epistemic groundedness that less certain propositions lack.

Wittgenstein contends that it is in the very nature of these Moorean certainties, in virtue of the fact that they are optimally certain, that they cannot be coherently thought of as rationally grounded. Wittgenstein maintains that which we are most certain of must be by its very nature rationally groundless.

Consider the Moorean certainty that one has two hands. Wittgenstein writes, 

> My having two hands is in normal circumstances, as certain as anything that I could produce in evidence for it. That is why I am not in a position to take the sight of my hand as evidence for it.

Wittgenstein is suggesting that to conceive of this proposition as rationally grounded is to suppose that the rational grounds are more certain than the proposition itself, which is ex hypothesi impossible since the proposition at issue is held to be optimally certain.

He highlights how odd it would be for one to treat one's conviction that one has two hands as being grounded in one's sight of one's hand. Consider the passage:

> If a blind man were to ask me “Have you got two hands?” I should not make sure by looking. If I were to have any doubt of it, then I don’t know why I should trust my eyes. For why shouldn’t I test my _eyes_ by looking to find out whether I see my two hands? _What_ is to be tested by _what_? (OC, §125)

In normal circumstances, one doesn't need to check by looking that one has two hands, indeed to check by looking would make no sense. If one doubts that one has two hands, then one ought not to believe what one's eyesight tells one, since this is no more certain that that one has two hands, which is in doubt.

Not only are these Moorean certainties necessarily groundless, according to Wittgenstein, but it also seems they are by the same token immune to rational doubt. For any rational basis for doubting the Moorean certainty would be necessarily less certain than the optimally certain Moorean certainty, and hence one would have more reason to doubt the grounds offered for doubting the Moorean certainty than to doubt the Moorean certainty itself.

Wittgenstein seems to be suggesting that there could be no rational basis that would *mandate* doubt of a Moorean certainty, since one rational response to the presentation of this ground for doubt could simply be to doubt the ground itself. That claim falls short of the stronger thesis that rational doubt of a Moorean certainty is impossible.

However, Wittgenstein wants to defend a stronger thesis. That is, that not only are Moorean certainties necessarily groundless, but that also rational doubt of a Moorean certainty is simply impossible. The very idea of rational evaluation, whether positive or negative, presupposes a backdrop of Moorean certainties that are themselves exempt from rational evaluation.

To attempt to rationally evaluate a Moorean certainty is thus an attempt to do something impossible. Wittgenstein repeatedly urges that the very idea of rationally doubting a Moorean certainty is incoherent. Doubt of a Moorean certainty is deemed akin to doubting everything, but Wittgenstein cautions that:

> If you try to doubt everything you would not get as far as doubting anything. The game of doubting itself presupposes certainty.

The picture that emerges is thus one in which all rational evaluation is essentially local, in that it takes place relative to fundamental commitments that are themselves immune to rational evaluation, but that need to be in place in order for rational evaluation to occur..

Wittgenstein refers to these fundamental commitments, the Moorean certainties, as the hinges on which rational evaluation turn:

> The _questions_ that we raise and our _doubts_ depend upon the fact that some propositions are exempt from doubt, are as it were like hinges on which those turn. 
> 
> That is to say, it belongs to the logic of our scientific investigations that certain things are _in deed_ not doubted.
> 
> But it isn’t that the situation is like this: We just _can’t_ investigate everything, and for that reason we are forced to rest content with assumption. If I want the door to turn, the hinges must stay put

Wittgenstein thus offers a radically new conception of the structure of rational evaluation, one that has important implications for the extent to which one can coherently undertake rational evaluations.

Both the skeptical project of offering a wholesale negative rational evaluation of our beliefs and the traditional anti-skeptical project of offering a wholesale positive rational evaluation of our beliefs are simply incoherent. The very idea of wholesale rational evaluation is itself unintelligible, for it is in the very nature of rational evaluations that they take place relative to hinge commitments that are both groundless and indubitable.

# Wittgenstein contra the Skeptical "Paradox"
---
Radical skepticism purports to be offering us a paradox, in the sense that it constitutes a fundamental tension in our folk epistemic concepts. We can divide anti-skeptical responses into *undercutting* and *overriding* treatments of the problem. Responses of the first kind demonstrate that the skeptical paradox is in fact illusory and arises out of faulty philosophical theory. Responses of the second kind concede that the skeptical problem trades on a genuine fundamental tension in our folk epistemic concepts but nonetheless argues on independent grounds for a form of epistemic revisionism that evades the paradox.

The kind of strategy Wittgenstein offers us is an undercutting strategy. If Wittgenstein is right, the possibility of localized rational evaluations precludes the possibility of global rational evaluations. So the shift from localized rational evaluations that occur in everyday epistemic contexts to the kind of global rational evaluations that the skeptic employs can look harmless, it's an illicit move. The problem arises from a faulty philosophical picture that masquerades as common sense.

Note that a crucial feature of the view is that it is an inherit feature of rational evaluation that it is local in the way that he describes. Wittgenstein's conception of the structure of rational evaluation  excludes even the possibility that the radical skeptic's wholesale rational evaluations could constitute a purified version of our everyday local rational evaluation. It is incoherent! 

If this conception where to be made defensible, it would have far-reaching ramifications for epistemology. The difficulty is in turning Wittgenstein's sketchy remarks into a concrete proposal. We want to develop this proposal in a way that it doesn't end up looking like a form of radical skepticism in disguise.

After all, being told that rational support takes place relative to a backdrop of ungroundable certainties does sound an awful lot like skepticism. The regress of reasons comes to and end, but instead of reaching some special foundation we reach bedrock and discovery only a rationally groundless "animal" commitment. A kind of "primitive" trust.

# A Core Problem for the Wittgensteinian Account of the Structure of Rational Evaluation.
---
Non-hinge commitments are presumably beliefs in a normal way and are ordinarily supported by reasons. Hinge commitments are a more controversial class. They can't be supported by reasons. But now we face a puzzle, is it not possible to reason one's way from rationally held belief in non-hinge propositions to beliefs in the proposition at issue in hinge commitments?

If that's correct, then why can't one's hinge commitments be thought of as rationally held beliefs after all? Conversely, if we are unable to do this, then doesn't that undermine the idea of even local rational such that local rational support is ultimately no rational support at all.

Let's take a concrete example based on one that Wittgenstein himself discusses. One can surely known on a rational basis that Napoleon won the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805. But a relevant hinge commitment in the background here on the Wittgensteinian picture is presumably that the Earth has existed for a relatively long time, and didn't just spring into existence in the last five minutes replete with the traces of a distant ancestry. Qua hinge commitment, this is not the kind of commitment that could be rationally supported. And that seems right.

However, the knowledge of the historical claim regarding Napoleon's victory entails the denial of the target "historical" radical skeptical hypothesis. If the former is rationally supported, then what is stopped the agent from inferring, on this rational basis, that the latter anti-skeptical claim must also obtain? Once such an inference is made, doesn't our agent thereby have a rationally grounded belief in a hinge proposition? And if they don't, then how can it be that they still have a bona fide rational basis for believing in the concrete historical claim.

The problem in play here essentially concerns the universality of rational evaluation thesis, and the related claim that one can harmlessly extend the scope of one's rational evaluations by making closure_rk-based inferences from one's current stock of rationally grounded knowledge.

Given the closure_rk principle, if one has rationally grounded knowledge that Napoleon won the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, and one completely deduces on this basis that the universe did not come into existence five minutes ago, then via this principle one ought to have rationally grounded knowledge of this hinge proposition. Conversely, if one is unable to have rationally grounded knowledge that the universe did not come into existence five minutes ago, then the subject's putative rationally grounded knowledge that Napoleon won the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805 is under threat.

It's hard to see how one could deny this principle. Given that competent deduction is by its nature a well-conducted rational process, how could it be that a belief gained via competent deduction and which was derived from rationally supported knowledge could be any less rationally supported than the belief from which it is derived?

With this principle in play it ought to be possible for the rationally articulate subject to undertake competent deductions from their rationally supported knowledge of non-hinge propositions and in doing so gain rationally supported knowledge of hinge propositions. This would be unacceptable on the Wittgensteinian account of the structure of rational evaluation, so either this principle goes or one denies that the non-hinge beliefs in these cases constitute genuine rationally supported knowledge.

Neither claim seems particularly appealing. To take the latter route seems to concede that the Wittgenstenian account of the structure of rational evaluation cannot deal with the problem of radical skepticism since it's tantamount to allowing that local rational support is ultimately no rational support.

So we either give in to radical skepticism or reject a highly intuitive epistemic principle. Call this dilemma the *closure problem* for the Wittgensteinian account of the structure of rational evaluation.

# Epistemic Ways of Developing the Wittgensteinian Account of the Structure of Rational Evaluation (I): The Externalist Reading
---
In the contemporary literature one can find several proposals which develop Wittgenstein's account of the structure of rational evaluation, though they often struggle to answer the closure problem.

This and the next account we give will share the following theme: while we lack a rational basis for thinking hinge propositions to be true, one's commitment to these propositions can nonetheless constitute knowledge. In this sense they count as *epistemic* proposals.

The first proposal is to ally Wittgenstein's account to a form of epistemic externalism that allows that one can have knowledge even in the absence of supporting reasons. The epistemic externalist hold that knowledge can be sometimes "brute". at least from a rational point of view, in that one possess it without having a rational basis for the target proposition.

This proposal means we needn't conclude from the fact that hinges lack rational support that they are thereby unknown. Call this the *externalist reading*. It's a form of neo-Mooreanism of the kind we encountered previously.

This reading potentially gives one a principled basis for rejecting the closure_rk principle and hence avoiding the closure problem set out. Proponents of this conception point out that while Wittgenstein's position is incompatible with closure_rk, it is compatible with the closure principle for knowledge *simpliciter*.

The closure principle is arguably more defensible than the closure_rk principle, on account of the fact that it demands less. One might be tempted to hold that we can live with the rejection of closure_rk principle just so long as we can retain the closure principle.

There are three key worries. First is the original problem we propose against externalist responses to skepticism.

Second is a general concern about the plausibility of denying the closure_rk principle. Recall that such denial commits us to "abominable conjunctions" like "I have excellent reason in support of my knowledge that Napoleon won the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805 but have no reason whatsoever for believing that the Universe was in existence at the time".

Third, notice that while epistemic externalism can open up the theoretical space within which we can make sense of an agent's possessing knowledge even in the absence of rational support for the target beliefs, it still remains to be shown that the target beliefs amount to knowledge by the externalists light. It's hard to see how such an account would go.

Consider the prospects of developing this account among process reliabilist lines. The difficulty is that it doesn't seem plausible to suppose that we know hinge propositions in virtue of forming the target beliefs via reliable belief-forming process.  Indeed, hinge commitments do not seem to be the product of any specific kind of belief-forming process, but rather a part of the tacit intellectual backdrop against which we acquire our beliefs in non-hinge commitments. 

For example, the hinge commitment that the universe hasn't come into existence five minutes ago was not acquired via a specific cognitive process but is rather presupposed in the specific cognitive processes by which I come to acquire particular historical beliefs.

But if our hinge commitments aren't acquired by a particular reliable-belief forming process, then they are not in the market for knowledge by the lights of this variety of epistemic externalism

This problem isn't unique to process reliabilist versions of epistemic externalism, since it's a common feature of epistemic externalist proposals that they evaluate a belief in term of the manner in which it is formed. 

Consider, for example, virtue epistemologies that are cast along epistemic externalist lines or the kind of modal conditions that are imposed by some forms of epistemic externalism, where the condition in question is almost always understood in a basis-relative manner.

# Epistemic Ways of Developing the Wittgensteinian Account of the Structure of Rational Evaluation (II): The Entitlement Reading
---
A second epistemic way of developing WSORE  is cast along epistemic internalist lines. This proposal argues that one can have knowledge of hinge propositions while lacking a rational basis for thinking these propositions are true. Accordingly, this stance rejects the closure_rk principle while retaining the closure principle.

What's distinctive about this proposal is that it appeals to a type of rational epistemic support, albeit a special kind of rational support that does not consist in reasons for thinking the target proposition to be *true*. This special kind of rational support is known as *entitlement*. Accordingly, this is called the *entitlement reading*.

The idea is that where we are obliged, on pain of cognitive paralysis, to be committed to certain propositions that we have no reason for thinking are true, then, as long as there's no reason for thinking those propositions to be false, one has a default rational basis, an *entitlement*, for these commitments. After all, one is surely rational in avoiding cognitive paralysis.

Thus a lack of rational basis for the truth of a proposition is compatible with there being a rational basis for believing it nonetheless. We noted previously that one distinctive feature of hinge propositions is that to doubt them would lead to cognitive paralysis. Hence our beliefs in hinge propositions pass the entitlement test and hence count as knowledge, even though we lack rational support for supposing these propositions true.

If we can know hinge propositions then in principle we can retain the closure principle.   But the closure_rk principle does have to go as it remains that one cannot have a rational basis for believing hinge propositions to be true.

Here gives issues with it but I'n already bored of this account.

# A Nonepistemic Way of Developing the Wittgensteinian Account of the Structure of Rational Evaluation: The Nonpropositional Reading
---
We need to take very seriously how Wittgenstein talks of these commitments as being utterly visceral-or "animal"-in nature, and conclude on this basis that such commitments simply are not in the market for knowledge.

We are not to think of them as beliefs at all, rather they represent ways of acting rather than a particular propositional attitude. We do not have knowledge of hinge propositions as there isn't the corresponding propositional attitude that could put us in the market for knowledge of these propositions.

Proponents of this reading point to passages in *On Certainty* that claim that what looks like a meaningful statement of an ordinary empirical proposition that purports to describe the world as being a certain way could in fact be anything but, such that conceiving of these statements as being on par with ordinary empirical statements reveals a fundamental mistake.

So when Moore asserts he has "two hands", it may look like a normal empirical claim, and while we can imagine unusual circumstances in which it would be a normal empirical claim, in the philosophical context in which Moore utters the statement what he asserts is, ipso facto, precisely *not* a meaningful empirical proposition.

Such a reading may enjoy the greatest support form the text itself, but we should remember our goals are not necessarily Wittgenstein's. It may ultimately have been Wittgenstein's intent to motivate his anti-skepticism by appeal to a highly context-sensitive account of meaning, we should be wary of saddling ourselves with this philosophical baggage if we can.

The core idea regarding the structure of rational evaluation offers us a way out of the skeptical problem, we needn't burden ourselves with philosophical baggage that makes ourself hostage to wider philosophical claims extending well beyond epistemology.

If it's impossible for one to adopt a propositional attitude toward hinge propositions, then of course one is not in the market for knowledge anyway hence we can block any inference to knowledge of them. We can thus accept the closure and closure_rk principle no problem.

Even if we can make sense of the idea of hinge commitments being ways of acting rather than proposition attitudes, the problem is it doesn't seem hard to convert ways of acting into a corresponding propositional attitude in such a way as to generate the closure problem.

For example, what is happening when an agent reasons from her rationally grounded knowledge that Napoleon's victory was in 1805 to the entailment that the universe must not have come into existence five minutes ago? Is not the result of this competent deduction a propositional attitude toward the entailed proposition? Something very much akin to a belief?

Before we endorse a non-propositional reading, we should first see if there are ways of developing WSORE that don't trade on such contentious claims.

# Concluding Remarks
---
We looked at WSORE, which entails that all rational evaluation takes place relative to essentially groundless hinge commitments and hence is inherently local. In principle this account presents us with an undercutting strategy that undermines the radical skeptic's attempts to offer a universal negative assessment of our epistemic position.

The difficulty lies in finding a plausible way of developing Wittgenstein's proposal. WSORE seems to come into conflict with the kind of reasoning at issue in closure-style inferences, in that inferences seem to license knowledge, perhaps even rationally grounded knowledge of hinge propositions, which conflicts Wittgenstein's proposal.

With that in mind we examined three ways of spelling out WSORE. The first two proposals are epistemic in character, in that they allowed that one could have knowledge of hinge propositions. Neither proposal was appealing. The epistemic externalist reading of Wittgenstein encountered many of the problems that we saw facing epistemic externalist anti-skeptical strategies in earlier chapters. The entitlement reading unraveled on closure inspection due to a failure to ensure that epistemic entitlement was compatible with the subject having the kind of propositional attitude necessary to be in the market for knowledge of hinge propositions.

That leaves non-epistemic readings, ones on which subjects cannot have knowledge of hinge propositions. One such version says hinge commitments are not to be understood in terms of propositional attitude, but rather as ways of acting. This reading enjoys support from the text, but it's wedded to contentious philosophical theses and hence is at a considerable disadvantage from an anti-skeptical point of view.

The development of a non-epistemic reading that does not carry additional philosophical baggage will proceed in the [[Hinge Commitments]]
