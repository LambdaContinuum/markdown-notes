# 1. The Contemporary Radical Skeptical Paradox
---
Radical skepticism of the Cartesian form specifically concerns our knowledge of a world external to us and proceeds by attempting to undermine the possibility that we might have knowledge of this world.

It pivots on the use of radical skeptical hypotheses, these are scenarios that are subjectively indistinguishable from a paradigm case of perception, but where one is in fact massively deceived.

We can take the BIV radical skeptical scenario as representative, this concerns an agent who from their point of view supposes herself to be in paradigm perceptual conditions, but who is in fact not perceiving a world around her at all. Her beliefs being in response to fake "perceptual" stimuli offered by supercomputers wired up to her brain which is floating, disembodied, in a vat of nutrients.

The initial plank in the case for skepticism comes from the contention that one cannot know that one is not a BIV. The claim seems compelling since the BIV scenario is ex hypothesi subjectively indistinguishable from normal perceptual conditions.

 What kind of rational ground might one have for such a belief given there is no subjective basis on which one can discern that one is not in a radical skeptical scenario? This gives us $(S_11)$:
 
> [!thesis] $(S_11)$ One cannot know that one is not a BIV.

The idea now is to demonstrate that this claim is in tension with our conception of ourselves as perceptually knowing a great deal about the external word. We can do this by considering a paradigmatic case of "everyday" perceptual knowledge. Let's call the proposition that I am presently sitting at my desk typing on my computer "E":

> [!thesis] $(S_13)$ One knows that E.

If one doesn't have the perceptual knowledge at issue in $(S_13)$ it's hard to see how one could know anything much.

The skeptic motivates the tension between $(S_11)$ and $(S_13)$ by the linking premise $(S_12)$:

> [!thesis] $(S_12)$ If one knows that one is not a BIV, then one cannot know that E.

How does the radical skeptic motivate $(S_12)$? The most common way in the contemporary literature is by appeal to some form of "closure" principle for knowledge. For example, the principle that knowledge is "closed" under entailment. Here is an initial formulation:

> [!definition] The Closure Principle: FIRST PAST
> If $S$ knows that $p$, and $p$ entails $q$, then $S$ knows that $q$.

So given that being seated at one's desk entails that one is not a BIV, it follows that if one did know the former then one would know the latter. Conversely, if one is unable to know the latter, then one would be unable to know the former.

The closure principle isn't convincing, there are all kinds of propositions that are entailed by propositions that, plausibly, one knows, but where it does not seem at all credible that one should know all these entailed propositions. 

We should restrict our attention to those propositions that one knows are entailed by what one knows.

> The Closure Principle: SECOND PASS
> If $S$ knows $p$, and $S$ knows that $p$ entails $q$, then $S$ knows that $q$.

This formulation has its problems. There is nothing in this principle that demands that the subject believes the entailed proposition on the basis of the relevant entailment. For example, if a subject believed the entailed proposition on a completely independent basis, then there would be no reason why her knowledge of the entailing proposition and of the entailment should incline us to regard this belief as amounting to knowledge. Instead, it would depend on the epistemic credentials of this independent basis for belief.

Such principles attempt to codify how one might legitimately extend one's knowledge via competent deduction from what one already knows. That this ought to be possible looks undeniable, but we haven't quite captured this thought in either formulation we just offered. This is why most commentators in the epistemic literature tend to formulate the closure principle diachronically.

> [!definition] The Closure Principle
> If $S$ knows that $p$, and $S$ competently deduces from $p$ that $q$, thereby forming a belief that $q$ on this basis while retaining her knowledge that $p$, then $S$ knows that $q$.

It's built into the principle that the subject is acquiring her belief in the entailed proposition on the basis of her undertaking a competent deduction from her existing knowledge. Moreover, since competent deductions are diachronic processes, it is important to specify that the subject retains her knowledge in the entailing proposition throughout.

As formulated, it is hard to see how the closure principle could be denied. Denying such a principle seems to commit one to endorsing the possibility of "abominable conjunctions", for example, that one knows that one is presently seated at one's desk, but that one has no idea whether one is a bodiless BIV floating in a vat of nutrients even though it's quite obvious the former entails the denial of the latter.

With this formulation of the closure principle, it follows that if one did know that E, then one could, via closure, come to know that one is not a BIV. The converse holds true as well. $(S_12)$ can be motivated via the plausible closure principle, and with $(S_12)$ and $(S_11)$ in play, the anti-skeptical $(S_13)$ is under threat.

This general pattern of argument can be repeated any number of times to call specific propositions into play, more generally, insofar as the skeptical can call into question our knowledge of something so straightforward, then the potentially devastating power of the skeptical argument is manifest.

What we have here is this a putative paradox, in that we have a series of claims that have been show to be intuitive or to be the consequences from intuitive claims, but which are in logical tension with one another.

>[!thesis] The Radical Skeptical Paradox (1)
> $(S_11)$ One cannot know that one is not a BIV.
> $(S_12)$ If one cannot know that one is not a BIV, then one cannot know that E.
> $(S_13)$ One knows that E.

We've determined the following three claims to be inconsistent:

>[!thesis] The Inconsistent Radical Skeptical Triad
> 1.  One is unable to know the denials of radical skeptical hypotheses.
> 2. The closure principle.
> 3. One has widespread everyday knowledge.

The three more specific claims, $(S_11-3)$, present us with a concrete instance of the triad. In doing so, they make the inconsistency at issue in (I-3) manifest.

Granting the triad is inconsistent, it follows that at least one of the claims that make up this triad must be false, since thy cannot all be true on pain of contradiction. Radical skepticism appears to call on us to claim something deeply counter intuitive. While we can think of radical skepticism as a philosophical position, such that it involves the denial of (3), it is in fact more interesting to conceive of it as a paradox, in the sense that we are confronted with a deep tension within our own folk epistemological concepts, once that does not appear to be amenable to any obvious solution.

If we conceive of the skeptical problem as a paradox, then we will not be tempted to try to deal with the problem by aiming to convict an actual skeptical *adversary* of some dialectical error, such as by claiming they are being incoherent in explicitly advancing their position. Suppose it was true that there is something seriously amiss with someone trying to actively advance the radical skeptical conclusion. Why would this offer us any intellectual comfort? We knew already that the denial of (III) is implausible, so it's not as if finding out that its rejection leads to incoherence is unexpected.

# 2. Undercutting versus Overriding Anti-skeptical Strategies
---
How might one go about responding to the skeptical challenge? By conceiving of the problem as a putative paradox, we impose constraints on the philosophically adequate responses to this problem. In particular, while denying one of the claims that make up the inconsistent triad is obviously a necessary ingredient in an adequate response to the problem, merely denying one of the claims is not suffice to resolve it in a philosophically satisfying way. What is further required is a diagnostic story to explain the intuitive appeal of the claim in question.

We can think of these diagnostic responses as being of two main varieties
1. *Overriding anti-skeptical strategy*, will offer a revisionary diagnostic story, one in which we have an independent theoretical basis for disregarding the relevant intuition in play. On this way of dealing with the problem, the skeptical paradox is bona fide, in that there is indeed a deep tension in our epistemic concepts, pre-theoretically understood, which is being exposed by this puzzle. But is is also resolvable, in that we recognize that there are independent theoretical grounds for revising our epistemic concepts in fundamental ways that avoid the puzzle.
2. *Undercutting anti-skeptical strategy*, a much more ambitious response to the problem. The diagnostic story on offer is meant to demonstrate that the skeptical "paradox" in play is in fact illusory. The aim of the approach is to show that although the skeptical problem seems to be arising out of a tension in our epistemic concepts, pre-theoretically understood, in fact it is the product of specific theoretical commitments that are revealed to be dubious. The skeptical puzzle is thus shown to be the product of faulty philosophical theory and not the natural manifestation of pre-philosophical common sense.

While both strategies can be adequate ways of dealing with the skeptical problem, undercutting strategies are clearly to be preferred, all other things equal. For is the skeptical paradox is bona fide, in that is arises out of an authentic tension within our pre-theoretical epistemological concepts, then even if we can supply a sound theoretical basis for rejecting one of the claims that make up the paradox, it will remain the case that the skeptical problem will generate intellectual unease.

In contrast, if we can show that the skeptical "paradox" is in fact illusory, such that no theoretical revisionism is called for, then clearly there is no need to regard this problem as generating any cause for genuine intellectual discomfort.

By the same token one could argue an undercutting strategy is in danger of being a response to the skeptical problem that is *too* strong. If the problem of radical skepticism is the product of illicit philosophical theory rather than ungarnished common sense, then why hasn't this fact made itself apparent long before? It is thus crucial to undercutting strategies to incorporate some account of why the theoretical basis for radical skepticism has been so hard to discern.

We will examine some undercutting anti-skeptical strategies in due course, but first we will look through some overriding anti-skeptical strategies. Our focus will be on the status of 1 and 2. We will examine and reject two rather crude overriding anti-skeptical proposals that, respectively, target each of these two claims. Understanding why these particular overriding anti-skeptical strategies fail to be compelling will enable us to et a better sense of what is at issue in closure-based radical skepticism.

# 3. An Overriding Anti-Skeptical Strategy (1): Nonclosure
---
Let's start with $(S_12)$. The natural way to object this claim is to challenge the closure principle that motivates it, and thus claim 2 in our radical skeptical inconsistent triad. Given the tremendous plausibility of the closure principle, it's going to be tough to mount a compelling case for such an anti-skeptical proposal.

To begin, note that it seems right to say that someone can come to perceptually know that she is presently seated at her desk (E) without first having any thoughts about whether she is a BIV, or the victim of any skeptical hypothesis. A fortiori, it seems right to say that someone can come to know that she is presently seated at her desk even though she does not know that she is not a BIV.

We might explain what is going on here by saying that our agent is effectively taking it as given that she is not radically and undetectably deceived about her environment, and that such an assumption is entirely reasonable.

In particular, given our agent has been given no rational basis to take the BIV error possibility seriously, it seems entirely reasonable for her to form her beliefs as if such an error possibility were false, even though, of course, she has no obvious rational basis for dismissing this possibility.

If that's the right way to characterize what's going on when one comes to perceptually know something mundane, then  we should be suspicious of the closure principle. This principle makes knowledge that one is not a victim of a radical skeptical hypothesis a requirement for mundane perceptual knowledge, when in practice it seems that one ought to be able to reasonably assume that such skeptical hypothesis do not obtain.

Moreover, although rejecting the closure principle goes against our intuitions, given we are faced with a paradox in this regard it is inevitable that we will have to deny something intuitive. Indeed, one may argue that that closure principle is less intuitive than the claim that we are unable to know the denials of radical skeptical hypothesis.

These are the outlines of a fairly rudimentary overriding anti-skeptical strategy that involves the denial of the closure principle. I doubt many would find such an approach persuasive. The appeal of this line of argument lines in how it seems to charge the closure principle with making extreme epistemic demands on our quotidian perceptual knowledge, such that if we are to have this knowledge then we must know the denials of radical skeptical hypotheses. But the closure principle makes no such demand. It's possible that an agent have mundane perceptual knowledge and fail to know the denials of any relevant radical skeptical hypothesis given closure is true.

Remember that the closure principle concerns the extension of knowledge from competent deductions. It follows that a subject who has had no occurrent thoughts about radical skeptical hypothesis and hence has not made inferences from what they know to the denials of radical skeptical hypotheses, would be completely unaffected by this principle. The closure principle makes epistemic demands only on those who have considered the problem of radical skepticism and so are fully aware of the tension between our everyday knowledge and our apparent inability to know the denials of radical skeptical hypotheses.

This anti-skeptical line thus misses its target, in that it doesn't engage with the particular nuances of the closure principle as we have formulated it in the setup of the skeptical paradox. The upshot is that the closure principle, when properly understood, is not susceptible to this critique, and remains standing.

It should also be noted that any anti-skeptical comfort that is offered by the point that closure affects only those who have become aware of the skeptical threat is severely limited. After all, once the skeptical argument has been made explicit, the subject will no longer have any epistemic insulation against its threat. Moreover, we can motivate the skeptical conclusion without appeal to the closure principle, in which case the epistemic insulation apparently on offer to those who haven't seriously reflected on their epistemic position is arguably illusory anyway.

# 4. An Overriding Anti-skeptical Strategy (2): Epistemic Externalism
---
The case for $(S_11)$ is that we cannot know we are not BIVs because it concerns a scenario that is indistinguishable from normal perceptual conditions.

$(S_11)$ may be challenged by an appeal to epistemic externalism.

Epistemic internalists demand that knowledge be grounded in a sound rational basis, where this sound rational basis consists of the possession of reasons in support of one’s belief in the target known proposition that are reflectively accessible to one. 

Epistemic externalists deny this claim and so maintain that there can be bona fide knowledge that lacks a sound rational basis of this sort. That is, epistemic externalists hold, contra epistemic internalism, that not all knowledge is rationally grounded knowledge.

For example, according to a crude process reliabilism about knowledge, knowledge is to be understood as true belief acquired via a reliable belief-forming process (i.e., one that generally generates true beliefs as opposed to false ones).

One could clearly satisfy such an epistemic condition and on this view count as having knowledge, even though one lacked any rational basis in support of one's belief. Thus epistemic externalism can allow that knowledge is possessed in cases that fail to satisfy the rubric laid down by epistemic internalism.

Notice that the rationale offered for why we are unable to know we are not victims of radical skeptical hypotheses seems to be explicitly epistemically internalist. 

The argument goes that since one is unable to introspectively distinguish between normal perceptual experiences and corresponding experiences of the BIV, one cannot know that one is not a BIV. That consideration suffices to demonstrate that one lacks a rational basis, internalistically construed, for believing one is not a BIV, but why should it follow for the epistemic externalist that knowledge is lacking of this proposition.

Couldn't it be the case that we can know that we are not BIVs but only in virtue of satisfying an externalist epistemic condition, such as a reliability condition?

Epistemic externalists will grant to the skeptic that epistemic internalism is much closer in spirit to our commonsense way of thinking about the epistemic realm, while nonetheless maintaining that there is a sound theoretical basis for rejecting such internalism in favor of externalism.

The skeptical case for $(S_11)$ is thus undermined, and with it the skeptical paradox as a whole.

The general type of anti-skeptical proposal in conflict with $(S_11)$ has been described in the literature as *neo-Mooreanism*. This is because the commonsense response to radical skepticism offered by G. E. Moore also proceeds by arguing that we can know the denials of skepticism hypotheses.

There are versions of neo-Mooreanism that have plausible internalist renderings.

Although the epistemic externalist is keen to break the logical link between knowledge and rational support, such that one can have the former without the latter, they surely do not wish to disengage our everyday knowledge from rational support altogether.

The skeptic can force a dilemma here. On the first horn of the dilemma is the charge that the epistemic externalist is offering no response at all to the skeptical problem. The second horn is the charge that the epistemic externalist is presenting us with an epistemic proposal that's so revisionist, so discontinuous with our ordinary epistemic practice, that even the most ardent proponent of epistemic would find it unpalatable.

# 5. Radical Skepticism about Rationally Grounded Knowledge
---
Imagine the skeptic simply reformulates the skeptical paradox in terms of rationally grounded knowledge. We have the following:

>[!thesis] The Radical Skeptical Paradox (2)
> $(S_21)$ One cannot have rationally grounded knowledge that one is not a BIV.
> $(S_22)$ If one cannot have rationally grounded knowledge that one is not a BIV, then one cannot have rationally grounded knowledge that E.
> $(S_23)$ One has rationally grounded knowledge that E.

The epistemic externalist has granted $(S_21)$, since her denial of $(S_11)$ turns on the claim that all the skeptic has in fact shown is that one's belief that one is not a BIV cannot be rationally grounded, and not that one cannot know that one is not in a BIV.

Trouble arises once we reflect that the epistemic externalist presumably does want to consider our normally everyday knowledge to be rationally grounded, and hence ought to want to endorse $(S_23)$. It's one thing for the epistemic externalist to offer a form of revisionism which says that bona fide knowledge doesn’t always require rational support, and quite another thing to suggest that even paradigm cases of normal mature human knowledge don’t involve rational support. Indeed, can’t I offer entirely adequate rational support for my belief that I am right now seated at a desk, and doesn’t this belief also amount to knowledge?

For the bridging principle, we can just reformulate the closure principle and it's just as intuitive. Consider the following "$\text{closure}_{RK}$" principle, where "RK" stands for "rationally grounded knowledge":

>[!thesis] The $\text{Closure}_{RK}$ principle
>If $S$ has RK that $p$, thereby forming a belief that $q$ on this basis while retaining her RK that $p$, then $S$ has RK that $q$.

Although this principle is more specific, and to that extent more demanding, than its sister closure principle, it is no less plausible. The same rationale motaives both.

We have in play now an inconsistent triad that is slightly different from that set out above:

>[!thesis] The Inconsistent Radical Skeptical Triad*
> 1\*.  One is unable to have rationally grounded knowledge of the denials of radical skeptical hypotheses.
> 2\*. The $closure_{RK}$ principle.
> 3*. One has widespread rationally grounded everyday knowledge.

Rather than radical skepticism being focused on knowledge *simpliciter*, this version of the triad is instead targeted specifically at rationally grounded knowledge.

On the one hand, the epistemic externalist could stick to a modest form of epistemic revisionism and so insist that our everyday knowledge is rationally grounded. Then they face basically the same dilemma, no headway has been made.

On the other hand, there is the option of endorsing a far more radical form of epistemic revisionism,  This form retains the closure principle and rejects 3\*.  Such radical revisionism could be motivated, but it would be a hard sell.

Overriding anti-skeptical strategies require a solid diagnostic story to explain why we should dismiss the natural intuitions that give rise to the skeptical puzzle, the greater the intellectual distance between the natural intuitions that give rise to the puzzle and the alternative revisionary account on offer, the harder it will be to mount a philosophically compelling case for why we should endorse the revisionary alternative.

If there are ways of dealing with the skeptical problem that are less revisionary, we should explore them first.

## 6. An Overriding Anti-skeptical Strategy (3): Abductivism
---
When justifying the plausibility of the claim that we are unable to know the denials of radical skeptical hypotheses, we appeal to the fact that radical skeptical hypotheses are ex hypothesi indistinguishable from corresponding scenarios involving normal veridical experiences.

We are effectively presupposing that one's rational support for believing that one is not the victim of a radical skeptical hypothesis must arise out of one's perceptual experiences such that if those experiences do not distinguish between normal veridical perception and radical skeptical hypotheses then one lacks a rational basis for believing that one is not the victim of a radical skeptical hypothesis. But couldn’t one’s rational support for believing such a proposition arise from other sources?

The obvious option in this regard is an appeal to some sort of *abductive* basis for this belief. While it might seem undeniable that one's perceptual experience alone cannot supply one with a rational basis for believing one is not the victim of a radical skeptical hypothesis, it does seem like there are abductive reasons for excluding this error possibility.

Isn't the hypotheses that one's experiences are veridical in the manner that one standardly takes them to be a better explanation of those experiences than any competing radical skeptical hypothesis?We call any response to the problem of radical skepticism that appeals to such an abductive rational basis as abductivism.

On its face, abductivism seems a plausible candidate to be an undercutting anti-skeptical strategy. What seems to be a radical skeptical paradox is in fact nothing of the sort, since claim (1) depends on an unduly restrictive conception of rational support.

The radical skeptic has thus failed to present us with a bona fide paradox.

Lets grant for the sake of argument that [[Models of the Development of Scientific Theories|abduction]] is a legitimate source of rationally grounded belief and thus, potentially, rationally grounded knowledge.

Notice that the most natural way of developing abductivism will appeal to considerations that are of dubious epistemic pedigree. One might regard the hypothesis that one is sitting at one's desk as opposed to being a BIV as abductively grounded in virtue of the former being more in keeping with one's existing network of beliefs than the latter. This would be an appeal to a kind of *principle of conservatism*.

This is questionable since we are seeking an *epistemic* basis for preferring the everyday scenario over the radical skeptical hypothesis, and this means a basis for treating the former to be more likely to be true than the latter. Why should an appeal to the principle of conservatism apply such an epistemic basis? The radical skeptical hypothesis incorporates an explanation for why we have ignored the rational skeptical hypotheses thus far, that they are indistinguishable from the everyday scenarios that we take to obtain. This means we cannot reasonably appeal to our background empirical beliefs in forming an abductive judgment about whether we can rationally dismiss a radical skeptical hypothesis.

A second dubious consideration is an appeal to the relative [[Systematizing the theoretical virtues|simplicity]] of the everyday scenario relative to the corresponding radical skeptical hypothesis. Although it is undeniable that from our perspective the everyday scenario does seem to be a simpler explanation, of what epistemic relevance is this fact? Simplicity, after all, is in the eye of the beholder—someone convinced by a radical skeptical hypothesis might well regard this skeptical hypothesis as offering a simpler explanation than the alternative everyday scenario. Indeed, if we are to weigh the simplicity of an explanation in ontological terms—i.e., in terms of how many entities it commits us to—then the skeptical hypothesis will presumably count as much simpler than the everyday scenario.

Moreover, as with appeals to conservatism, there is the further concern that simplicity is relative to one’s existing network of empirical beliefs, and yet the radical skeptical hypothesis is offering us an alternative explanation of one’s experience according to which those beliefs are radically in error. How then can an appeal to simplicity provide one with an epistemic basis for preferring belief in the everyday scenario over the corresponding radical skeptical hypothesis?

The upshot of this is that abductivism must restrict itself to a specific kind of abductive inference that doesn't involve appeal to one's background empirical beliefs, and hence doesn't employ the principles of conservatism or simplicity.

But that means that the kind of abductive inference in question will be very different from what we were originally envisaging, not least because it would be an entirely [[Kinds of Truths|a priori]] approach to the radical skeptical problem. The type of abductive inference would be quite unlike the standard variety of abductive reasoning that is found in everyday thinking and employed in scientific inquiry.

It's hard to see how such a purely a priori defense of abductivism would proceed. At any rate we can say that any such development of abductivism along these lines would be an overriding rather than an undercutting anti-skeptical strategy. The claim becomes explicitly revisionist in flavor. 

This is very different from the kind of anti-skeptical strategy that was originally advertised. It also means that if there are plausible undercutting anti-skeptical strategies available.

# 7. Concluding Remarks
---
Here we gave a version of radical skepticism which trades on a closure-style principle for knowledge. We argued that, properly construed, this type of skepticism presents us with a putative paradox.

The means that prospective anti-skeptical strategies will fall into are one of two camps: they will be *undercutting* anti-skeptical strategies that demonstrate that this putative paradox is not in fact bona fide, or else they will be *overriding* anti-skeptical strategies that grant the paradox is genuine but nonetheless offer independent grounds for rejecting at least one of the claims that make up this paradox.

We note that undercutting strategies are to be preferred to overriding ones and we examined three overriding strategies and found them to all be problematic.
