## Preliminary Exposition of the Thesis. The Impossibility of a Crucial Experiment.
---

Duhem states his thesis as a section heading thus:

> An Experiment in Physics Can Never Condemn an Isolated Hypothesis but Only a Whole Theoretical Group (1904--5, p. 18? \[260]).*

He expounds on it as follows:

> In sum. the physicist can never subject an isolated hypothesis to experimental test, but only a whole group of hypotheses; when the experiment is in disagreement with his predictions, what he learns is that at least one of the hypotheses constituting this group is unacceptable and ought to be modified; but the experiment does not designate which one should be changed, (p. 187 \[263]).

Let's introduce the notion of an observation statement. Let's take an observation statement to be a statement which can provisionally be agreed to be either true or false on the basis of observation and experiment.

According to the Duhem thesis, an isolated hypothesis in physics, h, can never be falsified by an observation statement, O.

As a generalization covering all the hypotheses of physics, this is somewhat doubtful. Physics does appear to contain some falsifiable hypotheses. Consider for example, Kepler's first law that planets move in ellipses with the Sun at one focus. If we observe a planet that doesn't lie on an ellipse of the requisite kind we have then falsified Kepler's first law. The schema of falsification can be written:

1. If $h$, then $O$, but $\neg O$, therefore $\neg h$.

Consider, however, Newton's first law of motion, dubbed T1, we cannot find an O such that the above schema holds when we substitute T1 for h.

Newton's full theory, T, consisted of three laws of motion, T1, T2, and T3, and the law of gravity T4. T is a conjunction of these four laws, $T = T_1 \land T_2 \land T_3 \land T_4$, From T by itself we cannot derive any observable consequences regarding the solar system. To do so, we need to add to T a number of auxiliary hypotheses, for example:

- That no other forces but gravitational ones act on the planets
- That the interplanetary attractions are small compared with those between the Sun
- That the mass of the Sun is very much greater than that of the planets
- and so on.

Call the conjunction of such auxiliary hypotheses which are appropriate in a given case A, we have the schema:

2. If $T_1 \land T_2 \land T_3 \land T_4 \land A$, then $O$, but $\neg O$, therefore $\neg(T_1 \land T_2 \land T_3 \land T_4 \land A)$.

So we know one of these hypothesis is false, but we cannot say which.

The history of science shows this is a very real problem in research.. Consider, the discovery of Neptune in 1846. From Newton’s theory T together with auxiliary hypotheses, astronomers were able to calculate the theoretical orbit o f Uranus (the most distant planet then known). This theoretical orbit did not agree with the observed orbit. This meant that either T or one of the auxiliary hypotheses was false. Adams and Leverrier conjectured that the auxiliary hypothesis concerning the number of planets was in error. They postulated a new planet Neptune beyond Uranus, and calculated the mass and position it would have to have to cause the observed perturbations in Uranus's orbit. Neptune was duly observed only 52' away from the predicted position.

Another difficulty was the anomalous motion of the perihelion of Mercury, which was found to advance slightly faster than it should do according to standard theory. Leverrier tried the same approach that had proved successful in the case of the Uranus anomaly, postulating the planet Vulcan nearer to the Sun than Mercury which would explain the advance in Mercury's perihelion. No such planet could be found.

The discrepancy here is very small. Newcomb gave its value as $41.24'' \pm 2.09$" per century. However this tiny anomaly was explained with great success by the general theory of relativity $T'$, which Einstein proposed in 1915 as a replacement for Newton's theory $T$. The value of the anomalous advance of the perihelion of Mercury which followed from the general theory of relativity was $42.89$ per century, a figure well within the bounds set by Newcomb.

The Uranus anomaly and the Mercury anomaly were *prima facie* very similar, success was obtained in one case by altering an auxiliary hypothesis, in the other by altering the main theory.

Duhem goes on to draw an important consequence from this thesis. Duhem uses the term *crucial experiment* in something like the sense given by Bacon in the *Novum Organum* to his 'fact of the cross'. He formulates this notion as follows:

- Enumerate all the hypotheses that can be made to account for this group of phenomena; the, by experimental contradiction eliminate all except one: the latter will no longer by a hypothesis, but will become a certainty.

There is an obvious objection to crucial experiments in this strong sense: namely, that we can never be sure that we have listed all the hypotheses capable of explaining a group of phenomena. Duhem agrees.

> Experimental contradiction does not have the power to transform a physical hypothesis into an indisputable truth; in order to confer this power on it, it would be necessary to enumerate completely the various hypotheses which may cover a determinate group of phenomena; but the physicist is never sure he has exhausted all the imaginable assumptions. (p. 190 \[266])

In view of this, it seems desirable to adopt a weaker sense of crucial experiment, which may be defined as follows:

- Suppose, we have two competing theories $T_1$ and $T_2$. An experiment, $E$, is crucial between $T_1$ and $T_2$, if $T_1$ predicts that $E$ will give the result $O$ and $T_2$ predicts that $E$ will give the result $\neg O$. If we perform $E$, and $O$ occurs, then $T_2$ is eliminated. If we perform $E$, and $\neg O$ occurs, then $T_1$ is eliminated.

In any event, one of the two theories will be eliminated by $E$, which is thus crucial for deciding between them. It does not follow that the successful theory is necessarily true, because there may be some, as yet unthought of, theory $T_3$ which differs from $T_1$ and $T_2$, but explains the whole matter much more satisfactorily.

If Duhem's thesis applies to $T_1$ and $T_2$, then we cannot derive $O$ from $T_1$, only from $T_1 \land A$, where $A$ is a conjunction of auxiliary assumptions. So, if $\neg O$ is the result of the experiment, this does not demonstrate beyond doubt that $T_1$ should be eliminated in favor of $T_2$. It could be the auxiliary hypotheses in $A$ is at fault.

Duhem illustrates this with a famous example of an alleged crucial experiment in the history of science: Foucault's experiment which was designed to decide between the wave theory and the particle theory of light.

The wave theory of light predicted that the velocity of light in water should be less than its velocity in air, whereas the particle theory predicted that the velocity of light in water should be greater than its velocity in air.

Foucault devised a method for measuring the velocity of light in water, and found that it was actually less than the velocity of light in air.  Here we seem to have a crucial experiment which decides definitely in favor of the wave theory of light. In fact, some of Foucault's contemporaries maintained that it was a crucial experiment in this sense.

Duhem pointed out however, that to derive from the particle theory that the velocity  of light in water is greater than its velocity in air, we need not just the assumption that light consists of particles (the fundamental hypothesis of the particle theory), but many auxiliary assumptions as well. The particle theory could always be saved by altering some of the auxiliary assumptions. As Duhem puts it:

> For it is not between two hypotheses, the emission and wave hypotheses, that Foucault’s experiment judges trenchantly; it decides rather between two sets of theories each of which has to be taken as a whole, i.e. between two entire systems, Newton’s optics and Huygens’ optics’ (p. 189 \[265]).

So according to Duhem, Foucault's experiment is not a crucial experiment in a strictly logical sense. We'll see however, there is another weaker sense in which the experiment is crucial, even for Duhem.

## Duhem's Criticisms of Conventionalism. His Theory of Good Sense (*le bon sens*)
---
Duhem is sometimes classified as a conventionalist as regards his philosophy 
f science, but he is certainly not a conventionalist in the sense of Le Roy and Poincare. He formulates their conventionalist position as follows:

> Certain fundamental hypotheses of physical theory cannot be contradicted by any experiment, because they constitute in reality definitions, and because certain expressions in the physicist’s usage take their meaning only through them’ (p, 209 \[271]).

Duhem objects strongly to Poincare's claim that the principles of Newtonian mechanics will never be given up, because they are the simplest conventions available and cannot be contradicted by experiment. According to Duhem:

> The history of science should show that it would be very imprudent for us to say concerning a hypothesis commonly accepted today: 'We are certain that we shall never be led to abandon it because of a new experiment, no matter how precise it is.’ Yet M. Poincare does not hesitate to make this assertion concerning the principles of mechanics.

According to Duhem, Poincare's mistake was to take principle of mechanics singly and in isolation. It's true that when a principle of mechanics is taken in this fashion, it cannot be either confirmed or refuted by experience. However, by adding other hypotheses to any such principle, we get a group of hypotheses which can be compared with experience. If the group in question is contradicted by the results of experiment and observation, it is possible to change any of the hypotheses of the group.

We therefore cannot say that certain fundamental hypotheses can never be altered.

Thus Duhem's position is more accurately described as *modified falsification*, rather than *conventionalism*. Duhem claims some hypotheses of physics, when taken in isolation, can defy direct experimental refutation. Thus he isn't a strict falsificationist. On the other hand, he denies that such a hypothesis is immune from revision in the light of experimental evidence.

Duhem's point is that, in the face of recalcitrant experience, the best way forward may be to alter one of the most entrenched assumptions. Duhem gives an example, the principle that light travels in a straight line. This was accepted as correct for thousands of years, but was eventually modified to explain certain diffraction effects.

Duhem even cites Newton's law of gravity as a law which is only provisional and may be changed in the future. The episode of the anomalous motion of the perihelion of Mercury fits Duhem's analysis perfectly. 

We find in both Duhem and Poincare a contradiction between philosophical view and scientific practice. Duhem was led by philosophical considerations to the conclusion that Newtonian mechanics is provisional and may be altered in future, yet he repudiated the new Einsteinian mechanics. Conversely, Poincare suggested in philosophical writings that the principles of Newtonian mechanics were conventions so simple that they would never be given up; yet, only two years later he decided that Newtonian mechanics needed to be changed. Some light is thrown on these strange contradictions by one further element in the Duhem thesis, his theory of good sense (*le bon sens*).

Let's take the typical situation envisioned by the Duhem thesis. From a group of hypotheses, $\{h_1, ..., h_n\}$, say a scientist has deduced $O$. Experiment or observation then shows that $O$ is false. It follows that a least one of $\{h_1, ...,  h_n\}$ is false. But which one is false? Duhem states categorically that logic by itself cannot help the scientist. As far as pure logic is concerned, the choice between the various hypotheses is entirely open. The scientist in reaching his decision must be guided by what Duhem calls 'good sense' (*le bons sens*).

Imagine two scientists who , faced with the experimental contradiction of a group of hypotheses, adopt different strategies. A alters a fundamental theory in the group, whereas B alters some of the auxiliary assumptions. Both strategies are logically possible and only good sense can enable us to decide between the two scientists. Thus, in the dispute between the particle theory of light and the wave theory of light, Biot, by a continual alteration and addition of auxiliary assumptions, tenaciously and ingeniously defended the particle theory, whereas Fresnel constantly devised new experiments favoring the wave theory. In the end, however, the dispute was resolved.

So let us take two theories, $T_1$ and $T_2$, which are both subject to the Duhem thesis. In a strictly logical sense, there cannot be a crucial experiment which decides between $T_1$ and $T_2$. The good sense of the scientific community can, however, lead it to judge that a particular experiment such as Foucault's experiment  is in practice crucial in deciding the scientific controversy in favor of one of the two contending theories.

Duhem’s theory of good sense (*le bon sens*) was derived in part from Pascal. Although Duhem was undoubtedly influenced by Pascal, it is possible to suggest factors of a more personal and psychological nature which may have led him to his theory of scientific good sense. As his writings on philosophy of science show, Duhem was a man of outstanding logical ability; yet, as a physicist, he was a failure. In almost every scientific controversy in which he was involved, he chose the wrong side, rejecting those theories such as atomism. Maxwell's electrodynamics, and Einstein’s theory of Relativity which were to prove successful and lead to scientific progress.

Duhem must've known in his heart of hearts that he was not proving to be a successful scientist. Yet he must've been aware of his own exceptional logical powers. Yet he must also have been aware of his own exceptional logical powers. This situation could only be explained by supposing that something in addition to pure logic was needed in order to become a successful scientist. Here, then, we have a possible psychological origin of Duhem’s theory of scientific good sense: namely, that Duhem saw that good sense is necessary for a scientist precisely because he himself was lacking in good sense. Duhem’s rejection of a new theory which agreed so well with his own philosophy of science is just another instance of that lack of good sense which characterized Duhem's scientific career.

Poincare, by contrast, was one of the great physicists of his generation and was amply endowed with the scientific good sense which Duhem lacked. The contrast between the two men is particularly evident in their respective discussions of electrodynamics. Duhem attacked Maxwell’s theory harshly, and advocated the ideas of Helmholtz. Poincare introduces Maxwell's theory with the words: 'Such were the difficulties raised by the current theories, when Maxwell with a stroke of the pen caused them to vanish'. Subsequent developments completely endorsed Poincaré’s support for Maxwell, while Helmholtz’s ideas on electrodynamics are now remembered only by a few erudite historians of science. It was Poincare's scientific good sense which led him, contrary to the principles of his own conventionalist philosophy of science of 1902, to a modification of Newtonian mechanics.

This is simply the starting-point for further analysis. What factors contribute to forming scientific good sense? Why are some highly intelligent individuals like Duhem lacking in good sense? There are important questions, however we will not turn to Quine's thesis.

## The Quine Thesis
---
In his famous article, "Two Dogmas of Empiricsm", Quine puts forward with a reference to Duhem a thesis which is related to Duhem's. Nonetheless, Quine's thesis is sufficiently different from Duhem to make the conflation of the two intellectually unsatisfactory.

The first obvious difference between Quine and Duhem is that Quine develops his views in the context of a discussion about whether a distinction can be drawn between analytic and synthetic statements, whereas Duhem does not even mention the analytic/synthetic problem.

There are two ways of defining an analytic statement. The first is due to Kant, who introduced the distinction. According to Kant, a statement is analytic if its predicate is contained (?) in its subject. This formulation presupposes an Aristotelian analysis of statements into subject and predicate. It's not surpsising that Frege, who rejected Aristotelian logic and introduced modern logic, should have proposed a new way of defining an analytic statement. Frege defines an analytic statement as one which is reducible to a truth of logic by means of explicit definition. 

These two ways of defining an analytic statement are both illustrated by the standard example, "All bachelors are unmarried". But Quine defines analytic statements in a third way, he writes:

> a belief in some fundamental cleavage between truths which are *analytic*, or grounded in meanings independently of matters of fact, and truths which are *synthetic*, or grounded in fact (1951, p. 20 \[280])

In effect, Quine is taking a sentence to be analytic if it is true in virtue of the meanings of the words it contains. This is the definition of analytic which is adopted by most modern philosophers interested in the question. It's still illustrated by the standard example S = "All bachelors are unmarried". Someone who knows the meaning of all words in S will at once recognize that S is true without empirical investigation. Thus S is analytic.

All this seems convincing; yet Quine denies that the distinction between analytic and synthetic is a valid one. He writes:

> It is obvious that truth in general depends on both language and extralinguistic fact. The statement ‘Brutus killed Caesar* would be false if the world had been different in certain ways, but it would also be false if the word 'killed' happened rather to have the sense of “begat’. Thus one is tempted to suppose in general that the truth of a statement is somehow analyzable into a linguistic component and a factual component. Given this supposition, it next seems reasonable that in some statements the factual component should be null; and these are the analytic statements. But, for all its a priori reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith.

The empiricists to whom Quine refers are, of course, the empiricists of the Vienna Circle, especially Carnap. Their particular brand of empiricism (logical empiricism) did indeed involve drawing a distinction between analytic and synthetic statements. However, support for the distinction is not confined to some members of the empiricist camp. Kantians too support the distinction.

What does this all have to do with Duhem and conventionalism? We can build a bridge by observing that the meanings given to sounds are determined by social convention. Indeed, the social conventions differ from one language to another. So if a sentence is true in virtue of the meanings of the word it contains, it is *a fortiori true by convention*. (?) Thus if a law is analytic, it is true by convention.. The converse may not hold.

Duhem used his thesis against the claim that a particular scientific law was true by convention. It is now obvious that exactly the same argument could be used against the claim that the law is analytic. Indeed Quine argues against the analytic/synthetic distinction along these lines.

To carry his argument through, Quine makes a claim (the Quine thesis) which is much stronger than the Duhem thesis. They key difference between the two thesis is expressed by Vuillemin as follows:

> Duhem's diesis (“D-thesis”) has a limited and special scope not covering the field of physiology', for Claude Bernard’s experiments are explicitly acknowledged as crucial. Quine’s thesis (“Q-thesis”) embraces the whole body of our knowledge.

Duhem does indeed place explicit limitations on the scope of his thesis, he writes: "The experimental testing of a theory does not have the same logical simplicity in Physics as in Physiology". He thinks that his thesis does not apply in physiology or in certain branches of chemistry, and defends it only for the hypotheses of physics.

(The authors own view is that Duhem is correct to limit the scope of his thesis, but wrong to identify its scope with that of a particular branch of science, namely physics. There are in physics falsifiable laws, whereas physiology and chemistry no doubt contain hypotheses subject to the Duhem thesis).

This is closely connected with a second difference. Duhem maintains that hypotheses in physics cannot be tested in isolation, but only as parts of a group. However, his discussion places limits on the size of this group. Quine, however, thinks that the group extends and ramifies until it includes the whole of human knowledge. Quine writes: "The unit of empirical significance is the whole of science". 

The Quine thesis is stronger than the Duhem thesis. Let's take, as a concrete example, one of the cases analyzed earlier. Newton's first law cannot, taken in isolation, be compared with experience. Adam and Leverrier , however, used this law as one of a group of hypotheses from which they deduced conclusions about the orbit of Uranus. These conclusions disagreed with observation. Now the group of hypotheses used was no doubt fairly extensive, but it did not include the whole of science. For example, there was no mention of the assumption that bees collect nectar from flowers in order to make honey, although such an assumption might have appeared in a contemporary scientific treatise dealing with a question in biology. We agree with Quine that a single statement may not be a 'unit of empirical significance' but this need not entail that 'the unit of empirical significance is the whole of science'. A group of statements which falls considerably short of the whole of science may sometimes be a perfectly valid unit of empirical significance.

Another difference is that Quine does not have a theory of scientific good sense. Consider Quine's statement: "Any statement can be held true come what may, if we make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the system". It's easy to see how Duhem would react to this, he would agree with Quine from the point of view of pure logic. However, someone who did so in certain evidential situations would be lacking in good sense, and indeed perfectly unreasonable.

Although the Duhem thesis is quite distinct from the Quine thesis, it might still be possible and useful to form a composite thesis containing some, but not all, elements from each of the two theses. The phrase *Duhem-Quine thesis* could then be used to denote this composite thesis.

## The Duhem-Quine Thesis
---
Let's say that the *holistic thesis* applies to a particular hypothesis if that hypothesis cannot be refuted by observation and experiment when taken in isolation, but only when it forms part of a theoretical group. The differences between the Duhem and Quine theses concern the range of hypotheses to which the holistic thesis is applied and the extent of the theoretical group for a hypothesis to which the holistic thesis does apply.

Quine, unlike Duhem, rightfully extends the holistic thesis to mathematics and logic. Duhem begins his treatment of geometry with the following remarks:

> Among the sciences of reasoning, arithmetic and geometry are the most simple and, consequently, the most completely finished; . . .
> What is the source of their axioms? They are taken, it is usually said from common sense knowledge (connaissance commune): that is to say that any man sane of mind is sure of their truth before having studied the science of which they will be the foundations.

Duhem agrees with the point of view. In fact, he holds what in 1915 was a very old-fashioned opinion. That the axioms of Euclid are established as true by common-sense knowledge or common sense or intuitive knowledge. A proposition from which Euclid's fifth postulate can be deduced is that, given a geometrical figure, there exists another geometrical figure similar to it but of a different size. Duhem argues that the intuitions of paleolithic hunters of reindeer were sufficient to establish the truth of this proposition. As he says:

> One can represent a plane figure by drawing, or a solid figure by sculpture, and that image can resemble the model perfectly, even though they have different sizes. This is a truth which was in no way doubted, in paleolithic times, by the hunters of reindeer on the banks of the Vézère. Now that figures can be similar without being equal, implies, as the geometric spirit demonstrates, the exact truth of Euclid's postulate.

Naturally enough, this attitude to the foundations of geometry leads Duhem to criticize non-Euclidean geometry, and, in particular, Riemannian geometry. This is what he says:

> Riemann's doctrine is a rigorous algebra, for all the theorems which it formulates are very precisely deduced from its basic postulates; so it satisfies the geometric spirit. It is not a true geometry, for, in putting forward its postulates, it is not concerned that their corollaries should agree at every point with the judgments, drawn from experience, which constitute our intuitive knowledge of space; it is therefore repugnant to common sense.

It is no accident that the non-Euclidean geometer cited by Duhem was a German. Duhem attacks German scientists by claiming that, while they possess the geometric spirit their theories contradict common sense, which is Duhem's new term for something like his old notion of good sense.

Given this general point of view, it is not surprising that we find Duhem condemning the theory of relativity. He speaks of ‘the principle of relativity such as has been conceived by an Einstein, a Max Abraham, a Minkowski, a Laue' forgetting the contributions of his own compatriot Poincare, he denounces relativity as a typical aberration of the German mind. Duhem says:

> The fact that the principle of relativity confounds all the intuitions of common sense, does not arouse against it the mistrust of the German physicists—quite the contrary! To accept it is, by that very fact, to overturn all the doctrines where, space, time, movement were treated, all the theories of mechanics and physics; such a devastation has nothing about it which can displease German thought; on the ground which it will have cleared of the ancient doctrines, the geometric spirit of the Germans will devote itself with a happy heart to rebuilding a whole new physics of which the principle of relativity will be the foundation. If this new physics, disdainful of common sense, runs counter to all that observation and experience have allowed to be constructed in the domain of celestial and terrestrial mechanics, the purely deductive method will only be more proud of the inflexible rigor with which it will have followed to the end the ruinous consequences of its postulate.

The development and acceptance of non-Euclidean geometry and relativity have rendered Duhem's attempt to found geometry on common sense untenable. It is surely now more reasonable to extend the holistic thesis from physics to geometry and to say that, in face of recalcitrant observations, we have the option of altering postulates of geometry as well as postulates of physics. This is, after all, precisely what Einstein did when he devised his general theory of relativity.

The picture is the same when we turn from geometry to logic. Duhem claimed that "There is a general method of deduction; Aristotle has formulated its laws for all time". Yet by 1915 the new logic of Frege, Peano, and Russell had clearly superseded Aristotelian logic.

We can now formulate what we'll call the Duhem-Quine thesis, which combines  some of the aspects of the Duhem thesis and the Quine thesis. We'll divide the statement into two parts:

1. The holistic thesis applies to any high-level theoretical hypothesis, whether of physics or of other sciences, or even of mathematics.
2. The group of hypotheses under test in any given situation is in practice limited, and does not extend to the whole of human knowledge. Quine's claim that 'Any statement can be held to be true come what may, if we make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the system' is true from a purely logical point of view, but scientific good sense concludes in many situations that it would be perfectly unreasonable to hold on to particular statements.
