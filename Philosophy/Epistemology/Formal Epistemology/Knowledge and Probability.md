Presume the issue concerning the [[Justification and Probability|structure of justification]] is solved, do we know things?

There are two premises, *Conspiracy* and *Knowledge-requires-certainty* that entail *Knowledge-skepticism*.

# Conspiracy
---
The first premise says that all your beliefs have credence less than 1. Formally,

*Conspiracy*
For all H, P(H) < 1.

Is this plausible? The possibility of various skeptical scenarios seem to show this premise.

Conspiracy is widely agreed upon but there are two qualifications that should be noted:
1. What if someone simply is certain of things? One should shift to what ought be believed. Even if they're 100% certain they shouldn't be and knowledge requires justified belief, not just belief. Conspiracy should be strengthened to say that all beliefs should have credence less than 1.
2. Is Conspiracy true for all beliefs? Arguments for tautologies could be questioned, but we won't do so here. Beliefs that we are 100% sure of are limited to logical and mathematical beliefs.

# Knowledge-requires-certainty
---
The second premise of our argument for Knowledge-skepticism is *Knowledge-requires-certainty*;

*Knowledge-requires-certainty*
If P(H) < 1 then you don't know H

This sets a high bar on knowing. We can restate it as "If A knows H then P(H) = 1". Another way of stating is that every alternative must be eliminated, understanding "Alternative" as a possibility in which not H, and "eliminated" as "has zero credence in".

*Knowledge-requires-certainty Reformulated*
If A knows H then A has eliminated all alternatives.

To be careful, this does not mean that if P(H) = 1, then H is known.

*Knowledge-requires-certainty* is more controversial than Conspiracy. The three arguments in its favor are the Lottery Paradox, a story about a detective, and concessive knowledge claims.

## First argument: The Lottery
Suppose you buy a lottery ticket. You know there are 100 tickets and that exactly one will win, so the probability your ticket will *lose* is 99/100. 

There's several reasons to think the correct verdict here is to say you don't know.

If you did know the ticket was going to lose, it would have been completely crazy to buy the ticket, but it isn't completely crazy. Compare someone buying a ticket to last week's lottery, after the jackpot is know to have been paid out to someone else. That would be completely crazy.

Imagine that instead of the ticket being for something good, it's for something terrible , such as being executed. No one would say that they know the ticket will lose in that situation, but the degree of belief is 0.99.

Knowledge closure is a plausible principle that if A knows H1 and A knows H2 then A is in a position to know H1 and H2. But knowledge closure leads to a contradiction if you know your ticket will lose.

Suppose that 0.99 probability your ticket will lose is enough for you to know it will lose. But every ticket has a 0.99 probability of losing, so you must know that every ticket will lose. By knowledge closure you are in the position to know the conjunction: ticket 1 will lose and ticket 2 will lose and ... ticket 100 will lose. But that's a contradiction because you know one ticket will win.

## Second argument: Detective
Dr. Black has been murdered and Poirot is on the case. Numerous suspects have been eliminated from the inquiry, and Poirot’s evidence is pointing at the butler. But the cook was also in the house at the time of the murder and has no alibi. Does Poirot know that the butler did it? Surely not. As long as it is a live possibility that the cook did it, Poirot cannot know the butler did it. He can strongly believe the butler did it, but it seems he cannot know the butler did it. Why not? The natural answer is that there is a possibility that the cook did it; P(The butler did it) < 1, therefore he cannot know the butler did it, that is, *Knowledge-requires-certainty*.

(holy shit what a dogshit argument)

## Third argument: Concessive knowledge claims
*Concessive Knowledge Claims* are statements that attribute knowledge of H to an agent and also claim that H might, from the agent's perspective, be false.

*Concessive Knowledge Claim 1*
I know it's raining but it might not be raining.

*Concessive Knowledge Claim 2*
Bob knows its raining but its possible for Bob that it is not raining.

*Concessive Knowledge Claim 3*
A knows H but it's possible for A that not H.

There seems to be something wrong with *Concessive Knowledge Claims.* Their oddity is explained by *Knowledge-requires-certainty* which entails that *Concessive Knowledge Claims* are contradictions

# Knowledge-Skepticism
---
1. *Conspiracy*, P(H) < 1
2. *Knowledge-Requires-Certainty*, If P(H) < 1 then you don't know H.
3. *Knowledge-skepticism*, You don't know H.

Some clarifications:
1. Knowledge-skepticism doesn't say that H is false.
2. Knowledge-skepticism doesn't say that you don't have justification. It merely means that your justification is insufficient for knowledge. Knowledge-skeptics can have conversations in which they assert H and explain how their belief in H is justified. They just think it falls short of knowledge.
3. The knowledge-skeptic does not say "I know we don't know anything". The knowledge-skeptic can just give us her reasons to believe that we don't know anything, without going so far as to say she knows we know nothing.

This is not an appealing thesis. There are two big problems:
1. Linguistic, knowledge-skepticism says that many of the things people say are false. People make claims about their knowing all the time. If knowledge-skeptics are right, then all of these claims are false, which means people are systematically misguided about what they know.
2. Epistemic, Knowing things is a desirable state to be in, the quest for knowledge is noble. But if the skeptic is right, this quest must be abandoned. We can never know anything.

# Defense of Knowledge-Skepticism: Assertibility
---
Can knowledge-skepticism be defended from the two problems above? A promising strategy can be found in the works of Unger and Schaffer. We need to concepts to understand this strategy.

Start with the concept of *absolute terms*. These are best explained by examples such as "flat" or "empty". Strictly speaking, an object is flat if and only if it has no bumps on it whatsoever. So almost nothing is really flat, there will always be some bumps even if only at the microscopic level. Similar to empty this is true of almost nothing really. So why do we often say things are flat or empty?

Our answer is that some things are false but acceptable to say in a conversation. It's acceptable to say that the fridge is empty when the hearer can be expected to understand that you aren't talking about air molecules. The air molecules aren't relevant. Similar to saying Kansas is flat, the hills aren't relevant, the hearer is expected to understand that you mean there are no mountains. These sentences are thus assertible, where assertible is understood as acceptable to say in a conversation. *Assertibility* is the second concept needed.

The result is that we can now hold that although it's false that the fridge is empty, the sentence "the fridge is empty" is assertible. Similarly, it's false that A knows H but the sentence "A knows H" is assertible.

Plausibly, "knows" is an absolute term, in the sense that in order to know something, all alternative possibilities must be eliminated, so most attributions of knowledge are literally false. But they can be close to being true, such as when the *relevant* possibilities have been eliminated. Under such circumstances, an attribution of knowledge is assertible, even though it's false.

Agents don't know anything because they don't eliminate all the alternatives, but the claim that agents know is assertible when the agents eliminate all the *relevant* alternatives.

This theory provides an answer to both the problems for knowledge-skepticism earlier. This theory explains why it isn't a problem that knowledge-skepticism makes many of the things we say about knowledge false, because they're still assertible.

It also shows that knowledge-skepticism doesn't threaten the enterprise of the quest for knowledge. Even if we cannot achieve knowledge, we can improve our epistemic state by eliminating possibilities. We can get closer to a state of knowledge even if knowledge is unobtainable.

But now that we have the concept of relevant possibility, what if the elimination of relevant possibilities was sufficient for knowledge itself?

# Relevant Alternatives Theory of Knowledge
---
What if we reject *Knowledge-requires-certainty*? Knowledge now requires that only the relevant alternatives are eliminated, not that all alternatives are eliminated.

*Relevant Alternatives*
If A knows H then A has eliminated all the *relevant* alternatives.

This principle denies *Knowledge-requires-certainty*. Now we need to ask: which possibilities are relevant?

## Safety, Subjective-Sensitivity, and Contextualism
We'll look at three main theories of what determines what possibilities are relevant.

Imagine possibilities arranged in order of how similar they are to actuality. Closest to actuality are possibilities that are only slightly different. Far away are possibilities where there are no planets, everything is in a computer simulation, etc.

1. *Safety* says that the relevant possibilities are those that are similar to actuality. Think of these are the possibilities that could easily have been actual. These possibilities form a fixed radius around the actual world. Safety is motivated by the thought that you cannot know something if it could very easily have been wrong. No need to eliminate distant possibilities, since they're so distant as to be irrelevant.
2. *Subject-Sensitivity* modifies Safety by adding that the radius of the circle can vary, and it varies depending on what is at stake for the knower. The higher the stakes, the more possibilities are relevant. On this view, whether someone knows the time by looking at their watch depends on how important it is that they get the right time. If it doesn't matter, only the nearby possibilities matter. So as long as the watch is fairly reliable they know the time. But if they're coordinating a bank raid that requires perfect timing, they don't know unless they have eliminated more distant possibilities, such as the batteries running out.
3. *Contextualism* agrees with Subject-Sensitivity that the relevant possibilities vary, but says that they vary depending on the context of the *speaker*, that is, the person ascribing knowledge, not the knower. Contextualism makes a claim about the meaning of a speaker;s utterance of a knowledge ascription like "A knows H". Different versions of Contextualism give different answers to the question of what it is about the speaker's context that determines which possibilities are relevant. We'll consider the version that says the possibility is relevant if it is being considered in the conversation. "Know" is similar to the word "short", we may say "Bob is short" when Bob is 6'1 but the conversational context concerns basketball players and so we're speaking truly. But someone else might say "Bob is short" and mean "Bob is short for normal humans", and that's false. "Short" means different things in different conversational contexts. The same sentence expresses different propositions when uttered in different contexts. 

# Evaluating theories of relevant alternatives
---
Here we'll see how each of the three versions of the relevant alternatives theory fares against the three arguments for *Knowledge-requires-certainty*. The Lottery, the Detective, and concessive knowledge statements.

## Safety
Possibilities are relevant if and only if it's similar to the actual world.

*Safety and the Lottery.* Knowledge-requires-certainty delivers the verdict that you don't know your lottery ticket will lose. Does safety deliver that verdict. The Safety theorist just needs to hold that the possibility where you win is *nearby*, and therefore relevant, and therefore destroys any knowledge that your ticket will lose. And it's plausible that the possibility where your ticket wins is nearby. Getting your numbers drawn might be unlikely, but it wouldn't take significant changes to the world to get it to happen.

But suppose that the lottery is secretly fixed so that someone else's ticket will win. There is no nearby possibility where your ticket will win. So according to Safety, there is no nearby possibility where your ticket wins, so you know your ticket will lose. This is problematic. (Why?)

*Safety and the Detective.* This supports safety

*Safety and Concessive Knowledge Claims.* The Safety theories needs to explain why such Concessive Knowledge Claims seem false. (Seem false to who? They don't seem false to me).

## Subject-Sensitivity
Subject-Sensitivity says that a possibility is relevant if and only if it is sufficiently similar given what’s at stake for the subject. The higher the stakes the more possibilities are relevant.

*Subject-Sensitivity and the Lottery.* Bob knows his ticket will lose only if he doesn't care too much about whether it will lose. If a lot is at stake, more possibilities become relevant, in which case he doesn't know. If Bob is insanely rich and it doesn't matter if he wins the lottery, he knows his ticket will lose. This seems problematic. The less you care about something, the more you know. It seems like according to Subject-Sensitivity you can increase you knowledge by smoking lots of weed and not caring about anything.

*Subject-Sensitivity and the Detective.* This has the similar issue as above.

*Subject-Sensitivity and Concessive Knowledge-Claims*. The Safety theorist has to explain away the appearance of falsity because if they don't care they're committed to these sorts of claims being true.

## Contextualism
The contextualism we're looking at says a possibility is relevant if it's being considered in the conversation.

*Contextualism and the Lottery.* It says that Bob doesn't know his ticket will lose as long as the possibility of the ticket winning is being considered in the conversation. Plausibly, given the structure of lotteries, the possibility of each ticket winning is always considered in a conversation about lotteries.

*Contextualism and the Detective.* Whether Poriot knows the butler did it depends on the conversation. This seems like a plausible response to the knowledge-skeptic. When the knowledge-skeptic raises bizarre possibilities they become relevant to the conversation and therefore knowledge claims are false in a conversation with the skeptic. But when they go away, the knowledge claims become true.

*Contextualism and Concessive Knowledge Claims*. These claims come out false. One the not H possibility is introduced into the conversation, it becomes relevant, so Bob doesn't actually know H. That's why Concessive Knowledge Claims seem wrong.

## Synthesis
We can combine elements of Safety, Subject-Sensitivity, and Contextualism. David Lewis for example argues that possibilities that are sufficiently similar to the actual world are relevant (a version of Safety); that possibilities that the agent ought to have sufficiently high credence in, given what's at stake, are relevant (a version of Subject-Sensitivity); and that possibilities the speaker pays attention to are relevant (a version of Contextualism).
