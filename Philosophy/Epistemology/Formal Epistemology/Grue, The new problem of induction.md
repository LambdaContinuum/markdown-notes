Let's grant all the Principles of Uniformity stated [[The problem of induction|previously]]. This isn't enough to solve the problem of induction.

There's a closely related but even more devilish problem, the *new problem of induction*. The root of the problem is there are many different ways in which the world could be uniform, so we need justification to believe that the world is uniform in one way rather than another.

# Bad Inferences
---
We'll assume we have justification for believing the following principle:

*Principle of Uniformity-Sampling*: Samples probably resemble the rest of the population.

This license the following plausible inferences:
1. All observed emeralds are green
2. Therefore, All unobserved emeralds are green

1. All observed ravens are black
2. Therefore, All unobserved ravens are black

In general, we have:
1. All observed Fs are G
2. Therefore, all unobserved Fs are G

Not all instances of this pattern are acceptable, consider the following examples:

Imagine a food critic, who has only seen chickens which were on his dinner plate, making the following argument:
1. All observed chickens have been dead
2. Therefore, all unobserved chickens are dead

Suppose I ask someone in the audience at a lecture how many siblings he has, he replies that he has one, and I offer the following argument:
1. All audience members I’ve asked have one sibling
2. Therefore, All audience members I haven’t asked have one sibling

1. All observed emeralds have been observed
2. Therefore, all unobserved emeralds have been observed

The later argument really nails the problem. It has the same structure as the others, but when the property we're talking about is having been observed, the mistake is obvious.

It seems that in some cases we can infer that observed patterns continue into the unobserved, but in other cases we can't. The essential question is what distinguishes the cases?

The most discussed example where this inference goes wrong was introduced by Nelson Goodman who used a made up word: grue.

# Grue
---
Let's invent the following word:

Grue = Green-and-first-observed-before-the-year-2100 or blue-and-first-observed-after-the-year-2100.

"Grue" is disjunctive. It applies to green things first observed before 2100 and to blue things not observed until after 2100. Consider a green emerald on the Queen's crown. It's observed before 2100 and is green so it's grue. Now consider a blue sapphire deep underground that will be unearthed after 2100. It is first observed after 2100 and blue so it's also grue.

Now let's apply the Principle of Uniformity, let's suppose that if some objects have a property, then this gives us justification to believe that other objects have the property. Let's apply this to grue emeralds. Our evidence is that many emeralds are green and first-observed before 2100. Applying the Principle of Uniformity allows us to infer that emeralds observed after the year 2100 will be grue.

1. All observed emeralds have been grue
2. Therefore, all unobserved emeralds are grue.

But emeralds first observed after 2100 are grue only if they're blue. So our observations of grue emeralds gives us justification to believe that emeralds first-observed-after-2100 will be blue. That seems crazy.

So we cannot apply an unrestricted version of the Principle of Uniformity. Applies to green it gives us reasonable beliefs, if applied to grue we get crazy beliefs. This is a serious challenge to the Principle of Uniformity. If it cannot be restricted to cases where it gives reasonble beliefs, it will have to be abandoned, allowing the old problem of induction to resurface.

There are two types of responses to the grue problem. The first is to find a principled way to rule out properties like grue and rule in properties like green for use in a Principle of Uniformity. The second is to argue that whether we should apply a Principle of Uniformity relies on our background beliefs.

# First Response: Projectible properties
---
Applying the Principle of Uniformity to some properties, green, blue, white, give reasonable beliefs, but applying the PoU to other properties, greenblue, greenelephant, grue, does not. Call the first set of properties *projectible* and the second set *unprojectible*.

Projectible = A property such that observed Fs having it justifies that unobserved Fs have it.

If we are to apply a PoU, we must restrict its use to projectible properties. The new restricted PoU is as follows:

*Princuple of Uniformity-Sampling, Projectible*
1. All observed Fs are G
2. G is projetible
3. Therefore, All unobserved Fs are G.

We need a general formulation of the distinction between projectible and unprojectible. There have been many attempts but none found much acceptable.
1. Goodman's own response was that projectible properties are those that have already been used with some success by scientists. Goodman called these properties *entrenched*. This correctly allows familiar properties like being green, or being an electron, and rules out properties like being grue. The problem is this implies that new properties that scientists come up with are not projectible. If scientists aren't allowed to come up with new properties and project, then scientific progress would stop.
2. A related view is that the problem with "grue" is that the word is made up. Perhaps, projectible properties are those that are referred to with non-invented terms. But scientists regularly invent new terms like "spin" and "charm", and they're projectible.
3. Perhaps we need to appeal to lawlike properties, which are properties that are of the right kind to appear in laws of nature. Properties like greenness are lawlike, properties like grueness are not. So projectible properties are the lawlike properties. There are two problems
	1. We now need criteria for being a lawlike property, and there's little agreement on how this can be done. We haven't made much progress.
	2. There seems to be projectible properties that are not lawlike. If all the coins in my left pocket are Euros, this justifies all the coins in my right pocket being Euros; but the property of being a Euro is not lawlike.
4. The new terms were introduced with definitions including "or". So perhaps all terms based on such definitions refer to unprojectible properties. This doesn't work, we could take "grue" as primitive and define"green" in terms of "grue".  Goodman's . Imagine an alien race that speaks a language similar to English, except they use the word "grue" in the way described here. They also use the word "bleen" to refer to objects that are blue-and-first-observed-before-2100 or green-and-first-observed-after-2100. The alien thinks our terms "green" and "blue" are disjunctive terms. When a visiting  alien anthropologist figures out our language it will write something like:
	1. Green = Grue-and-first-observed-before-2100 or bleen-and-first-observed-after-2100
	2. Blue = Grue-and-first-observed-after-2100 or bleen-and-first-observed-before 2011
   it will then have to go home and explain to its species that humans have these weird disjunctive terms instead of plain old "grue" and "bleen"
5. Maybe green is more simple than grue, and only simple properties are projectible. The alien example suggests this is not true. We need some independent account of which properties are simple. This applies to other names that "grue" gets called like "gerry-mandered" or "artificial".
6. Carnap claimed that properties that describe the intrinsic nature of an object are projectible, but properties that locate an object in time or space are not intrinsic. "Grue" makes reference to the time so it is unprojectible. An objection is that some projectible properties make reference to the time. For example, scientists think there was a period of inflation shortly after the big bang, in which the universe expanded at an exponential rate. This means there  were uniformities during the period of time that do not extend to other periods of time, for example, all objects moved away from each other at an exponential rate. Carnap can respond that he is only talking about the properties designated by our primitive concepts. For Carnap, languages have a number of primitive concepts plus complex concepts constructed from them. Projectibility is defined in the first instance over primitive concepts, and then derivatively over non-primitive concepts. Carnap's claim is only that projectible primitive concepts do not locate the object in time or space. This allows that a complex concept like "shortly after the big bang all objects moved away from each other at an exponential rate" is projectible. This response never took hold. Interest in defining projectibility has waned recently, in part due to the influence of Frank Jackson who argued that any attempts are doomed to fail.

## Objection to projectible properties
Frank Jackson argued that the attempt to make a principled distinction between projectible and unprojectible properties was misguided. It all depended on the context, in some contexts even grue was projectible.

Suppose we know that there is a species of shy chameleon that is blue when unobserved and turns green with embarrassment when observed. Observing such green chameleons does not allow us to infer that unobserved chameleons are green. Instead, we should infer that the unobserved  chameleons are blue, that is, all chameleons are grue. In this case, grue is projectible and green is unprojectible. 

It's a mistake think that some properties are projectibles and others unprojectible; instead, Jackson argued, it depends on counterfactuals.

# Second response: Sampling
---
## Jackson's counterfactual condition
The problem regarding chameleons is that observation makes the chameleons green. The chameleons would not have been green if they had not been observed; the Fs are G, but would not have been if they had not been observed. That's why the inference is bad. TO ensure a justified inference. we have to believe that the property does not vary with whether the object is observed. Jackson argues that we need to add the following counterfactual to the Principle of Uniformity:

*Counterfactual*: If the Fs had not been observed then they would still have been G.

The result is the following strengthened Principle of Uniformity:

1. *Principle of Uniformity-Sampling-Counterfactual*
2. All observed Fs are G
3. If they had not been observed, they would still have been G
4. Therefore, All unobserved Fs are G

This counterfactual holds for familiar properties, for example being Green:
1. *Principle of Uniformity-Sampling-Counterfactual*
2. All observed emeralds are green
3. If they had not been observed, they would still have been green
4. Therefore, all unobserved emeralds are green

And doesn't hold for the problem cases:
1. *Principle of Uniformity-Sampling-Counterfactual*
2. All observed emeralds are grue
3. If they had not been observed, they would still have been grue
4. Therefore, All unobserved emeralds are grue.

If the emeralds had not been observed, they would *not* have been grue. If they hadn't been observed, they would still be underground, remain unobserved until after 2100, and therefore not be grue. So we get the correct verdict. 

## Objection to Jackson's counterfactual solution
There are cases where Jackson's counterfactual holds, but for which we don't think the inference is justified. Recall the food critic inference:

1. *Principle of Uniformity-Sampling-Counterfactual* 
2. All observed chickens are dead
3. If they had not been observed, they would still have been dead
4. Therefore, All unobserved chickens are dead.

The counterfactual evaluates to true (consider that the closest possibilities are ones in which the chickens are still dead, for example they ordered fish instead of chicken), and so Jackson gives the wrong verdict for this inference.

Suppose I call people at home and ask who they'll vote for at the next election. I know that people at home are more likely to be unemployed, and unemployed people are more likely to vote Democrat. If 60% of my sample will vote for Democrat, I should not infer that 60% of voters will vote Democrat. But I believe the counterfactual condition: for each person in my sample, if they had not been in my sample they would still vote Democrat because the nearest possibility is one where they don't get to the phone in time or the call doesn't go through, they'll still have the same political preferences. This suggests to solve the problem we need to make sure we have a representative sample.

## Random sampling
In problem cases the sample was not representative of the population with respect to the property at issue. Say a sample is representative with respect to property G if and only if the proportion of G in the sample is the same as the proportion of G in the population. We can strengthen the Principle of Uniform:

*Principle of Uniformity-Sampling-Representative*
1. All observed Fs are G
2. The sample is representative
3. Therefore, All unobserved Fs are G

To use this principle, we would have to have a justified belief that the sample is representative. This requires information about what the unobserved parts of the population are like, but if we had that we wouldn't need to make an inference in the first place.

However, we can know how the sample was selected. Every sample is selected by some procedure, and we often know the procedure. We want an unbiased procedure.

A selection procedure is unbiased with respect to property G if and only if being G is (probabilistically) independent of the sample.

Consider the following:
*Principle of Uniformity-Sampling-Representative*
1. All observed Fs are G
2. The selection procedure was unbiased with respect to G
3. Therefore, All unobserved Fs are G

This gives us a usable principle. It also gives the right verdict in many problem cases. The procedure for observing emeralds is biased with respect to grue; by the definition of grue observed green emeralds are all grue whereas non-observed green emeralds are not grue. As all emeralds happen to be green the result is that "grue" is synonymous with "observed".

The grue problem is clever because the definition of "grue" builds a selection bias into the property. It's impossible to get a sample which is unbiased with respect to grue, because being in the sample affects whether something is grue.

This principle also gives the right verdict for non-problem cases. If we think green emeralds are as likely to be observed as non-green emeralds we should infer that unobserved emeralds are green.

## Objections to random sampling
Do we have justification to believe that the selection procedure was unbiased with respect to G? it depends what G is. We need *a priori* justification to believe that our selection procedure is unbiased. If we have this, we have reason to believe that the sample is representative, and both the new and old problems of induction would be solved.

# Summary
---
Even if we grant the world is uniform, the problem of induction remains because there are lots of different ways the world could be uniform. One response is to identify a privileged set of properties as projectible, and only apply the PoU to those. It's unclear how these privileged properties could be identified. Another response argues that the PoU can only be applied when the sample has been selected in the right way. This approach must steer a path between conditions that are too weak and allow bad inferences and conditions that are too strong and useless in practice. An unbiased procedure would solve this problem but it's not obvious that we have reason to think our procedures are unbiased.
