## Three Distinctions among truths
There are three interesting ways to divide up the class of true statements:
1. the *analytic* truths from the *synthetic* one
2. the *a priori* truths from the *a posteriori* ones
3. the *necessary* truths from the *contingent* ones

The first distinction is *semantic*, dealing with meaning; the second is *epistemic*; dealing with knowledge; the third is *metaphysical*; dealing with the nature of things.

## Analytic and Synthetic
Analytic truths are true by definition. That is to say their truth is guaranteed by the meaning of words used to state them. Here are some examples:
- All triangles have three sides.
- A vixen is a female fox.
- If John is Jane's brother, she is his sister.

Synthetic truths are those which are not analytic. Their truth depends not just on the meaning of words but on the actual facts. Here are some examples:
- Blackbirds eat worms.
- Bristol is west of Manchester.
- The sun has eight plants.

## A Priori and A Posteriori
This distinction has to do with kinds of knowledge rather than the meanings of words.

A true statement is *a priori* if it can be *known* prior to experience of the facts. This is to say, in principle you could figure out an a priori truth just by sitting in an armchair with your eyes shut and thinking hard.

Obvious examples of a priori truths are analytic truths. If you understand the statement *triangles have three sides* you won't need to examine any physical triangles to know the statement is true.

A true statement is *a posteriori* if it can be known as a result of relevant experiences. *Blackbirds eat worms* is an example of an a posteriori truth.

Note that the requirements for a truth to be a priori is that it *can* be known prior to experience, not that it must be known that way.

One last point about a priority. The idea is not that an a priori statement can be known prior to *any* experience whatsoever, for some experience may be necessary in order to understand the statement in the first place. Rather, the requirement is that once you have enough experience to understand the statement, you don't need any further experience to know it's true.

For example: You may need some experience of the world to acquire concepts as *triangle* and *side*, but once who have acquired these concepts you can known *triangles have three sides* without any further investigation. By contrast, someone can possess the concepts *blackbirds* and *worm* but still not be in a position to know that *blackbirds eat worms*.

## Synthetic A Prioris
Before dealing with the third distinction, let's think about the relationship between our first two distinctions, analytic/synthetic and a priori/a posteriori.

Remember, our first distinction is *semantic*, having to do with definitions of words, while our second is *epistemic*, having to do with the acquisition of knowledge. It's not taken for granted that these two distinctions line up.

We can see that *any* analytic statement can be known a priori: If the truth of some statement is guaranteed by the meanings of the words it contains, then someone who grasps those meanings will be in a position to work out that it's true.

But are analytic truths the *only* statements that can be known a priori? Or does the realm of things that can be known a priori extend into synthetic truths? In short, **are there any synthetic a priori truths?**

Here are some examples of supposed synthetic a priori truths:
- *all triangles contain 180 degrees*
- *every event has a cause*
- *nothing can be both red and green all over*

(In fact, the traditional rationalists, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, are often said to be distinguished from the empiricists, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, by their belief in synthetic a priori knowledge. But take this with a pinch of salt. It's true that synthetic a priori knowledge was more important to continental rationalists, than to British empiricists, the latter group by no means rejected all examples of this category.)

Geometry provides the most plausible example of synthetic a priori knowledge. Consider *all triangles contain 180 degrees*. This seems synthetic, it tells us if you cut off the three corners of a paper triangle and then arrange them together, they will make a nice straight line. This looks like a substantial fact about the world, not something guaranteed by definition.

But at the same time it looks as if we can prove this statement a priori, by means of the familiar schoolbook demonstration.

## How is Synthetic A Priori Knowledge possible?
How we can possibly know a statement to be true prior to experience, if the concepts used to frame it leave it open that it might be false? The truth of such synthetic statements depends on the actual facts, as well as on the concepts involved, but how can we know what these facts are, prior to any experience of them?

1. God, he has endowed us with a 'natural light of reason' which enables us to identify certain basic truths prior to experience. We can know the truths of geometry and other such fundamental principles a priori because God has arranged our minds to make these things apparent to us. Towards the middle of the 18th century, this answer ceased to be acceptable among mainstream philosophers. As a result, synthetic a priori knowledge has become a problematic category for modern philosophy.

2. Kant offered a novel defense of synthetic a priori knowledge, arguing that certain assumptions, such as the principles of geometry, must be true of any world which we can experience. This approach requires an idealist metaphysics.

3. Biological natural selection accounts for synthetic a priori knowledge. Rather than God, our biological history has shaped our minds to make certain truths a priori apparent to us. Say our biological history predisposes us strongly to certain assumptions about the world, are these innate assumptions *knowledge*? Natural selection is an unreliable informant. It instills beliefs that are practically useful in helping us survive, but these need not always be true. For example: Humans are arguably inclined to believe that physical objects will stop moving unless pushed, in contradiction to modern physics. A benevolent God would instill nothing but truths in us, but the practically useful assumptions given to us by natural selection can't be taken for granted.

## Pure and Applied Geometry
If we reject synthetic a priori knowledge, what about the earlier example of *all triangles contain 180 degrees*? They looked like good cases of synthetic a priori knowledge.

Modern physics suggests such a statement, far from being knowable a priori, is not even true. Actual space is 'bent' in such a way that straight lines, defined as the shortest distance between two points, can form triangles whose internal angles do not sum to 180 degrees.

One may object to this argument against a priori geometry, on the grounds that lines in a bent physical space are not really straight. Euclid laid down a set of axioms for geometry over two thousand years ago that specifies a number of properties of points and straight lines. Sticking to these axioms, all triangles made of Euclidean straight lines will contain 180 degrees.

However, while this line of thought does yield a kind of a priori geometrical knowledge, this knowledge has ceased to be *synthetic*. If you insist nothing counts as a straight line unless it satisfies the axioms of euclidean geometry, you render all the claims of euclidean geometry analytic matters of definitions.

We can distinguish between two ways of understanding geometry. *Applied* geometry is in effect a scientific theory of real physical space. We start by specifying how terms like 'point' and 'straight line' refer to items in the real world, and in particular specify straight lines are the shortest distances between points in real physical space. Once we've defined our terms in such a way, it is then a synthetic question whether 'straight lines' satisfy the axioms of Euclidean geometry, and consequently whether all triangles contain 180 degrees. But this synthetic question cannot be answered a priori. We need a posteriori experience of the world in the form of scientific measurement and experimental results to tell whether real space is Euclidean. Indeed the a posteriori answer to this question turns out to be 'no', modern physics tells us that real space does not satisfy the axioms of euclidean geometry.

We can alternatively treat geometry as purely mathematical construction with no implication about the structure of physical space. In this *pure* geometry we start by specifying axioms and derive the entailment's. Such knowledge is available a priori, but only because it is analytic.

Either way, geometry fails to deliver any synthetic a priori knowledge.
