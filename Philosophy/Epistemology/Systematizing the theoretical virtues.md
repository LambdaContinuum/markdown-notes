## Introduction
---
Theoretical virtues are the traits of a theory that show it is probably true or worth accepting. Many scholars agree these virtues help us to infer which rival theory is the best explanation

The most widely accepted theories across the academic disciplines usually exhibit the following theoretical virtues. Each virtue class contains at least three virtues that sequentially follow a repeating pattern of progressive disclosure and expansion.

**Evidential Virtues.**
1. *Evidential accuracy*: A theory, $T$, fits the empirical evidence well (regardless of causal claims).
2. *Causal adequacy*: $T$'s causal factors plausibly produce the effects in need of explanation.
3. *Explanatory depth*: $T$ excels in causal history depth or in other depth measures such as range of counterfactual questions that its law-like generalizations answer regarding the item being explained.

**Coherential Virtues.**
4. *Internal consistency*: $T$'s components are not contradictory
5. *Internal coherence*: $T$'s components are coordinated into an intuitively plausible whole; $T$ lacks ad hoc hypotheses, i.e. theoretical components merely tacked on to solve isolated problems.
6. *Universal coherence*: $T$ sits well with (or is not obviously contrary to) other warranted beliefs.

**Aesthetic Virtues.**
7. *Beauty*: $T$ evokes aesthetic pleasure in properly functioning and sufficiently informed persons.
8. *Simplicity*: $T$ explains the *same facts* as rivals, but with *less* theoretical content.
9. *Unification*: $T$ explains *more kinds of facts* than rivals, with the *same* amount of theoretical content.

**Diachronic Virtues.**
10. *Durability*: $T$ has survived testing by successful prediction or plausible accommodation of new data.
11. *Fruitfulness*: $T$ has generated additional discovery by means such as successful novel prediction, unification, and non ad hoc theoretical elaboration.
12. *Applicability*: $T$ has guided strategic action or control, such as in science-based technology.

## Evidential Theoretical Virtues

### Evidential accuracy
Evidential accuracy is instantiated in a theory when it fits the empirical evidence.

Prior to Galileo's telescopic discoveries of 1609-1610, the evidential accuracy of the contending geocentric and heliocentric astronomical systems were roughly equal. After the telescope showed Venus going through many moon-like phases that would be impossible if Ptolemy's ancient geocentric theory were true, this narrowed the contending systems down to Copernicus' heliocentric theory and Tycho Brahe's geoheliocentric system. In the Tychonic system the Sun and fixed stars revolve around a central-stationary earth. The planets revolve around the sun as their moving center.

If evidential accuracy were the only recognized criterion for theory choice at the time, then astronomers would have had insufficient reason to accept the heliocentric theory. 

Thankfully, Kepler articuled further virtues. In addition to evidential accuracy, conceived since antiquity mainly as the match between mathematical astronomical theory (chiefly combinations of circular motions) and the observed apparent motions of planets, Kepler also insisted that astronomers evaluated theories by the physical plausibility of causal components.

### Causal adequacy
A theory is causally adequate if it specific causal factors that plausibly produce the effect in needs of explanation. Longino argues that often an adequate causal account must include multiple factors operating in a web of mutual interaction, rather than a single unidirectional cause and effect relationship. In some cases a good explanation includes appeals to geometrical or other reasons. For example, one might explain a free particle's path by its conformity to a geodesic in spacetime, a geometrical spacetime reason. Such an explanation might be "causally adequate" in a broad sense.

A celebrated episode in the history of geology illuminates the relation between evidential accuracy and causal adequacy. During much of the twentieth century the theory of continental drift enjoyed a modest degree of evidential accuracy (e.g., geological continuity between continents, including complementary shapes and similar fossils), but lacked causal adequacy. 

After a few decades of being underappreciated, the theory gained extensive new support from paleomagnetic and related seafloor spreading studies. This vastly expanded the theory's evidential accuracy. Despite the earlier decades of complaints of a lack of plausible causal mechanism for continental drift, the updated theory (known as plate tectonics) became widely accepted in the late 1960s based on its stronger evidential accuracy, despite its continued lack of causal adequacy.  Later evidence implicated circulating convection currents in the hot soft mantle below the relatively rigid oceanic and continental plates. Many argued this explained plate movement, rendering the theory causally adequate.

A third kind of evidential virtue, explanatory depth, increased as the theory of mantle convection currents was supplemented with several other associated factors. Geophysicists found other processes that contribute to plate movement, which generated more causal history depth.

### Explanatory depth
A theory exhibits explanatory depth when it excels in causal history depth or in other depth measures such as the range of counterfactual questions that its law-like generalizations  answer regarding the item being explained.

Causal history depth is often characterized in a causal-mechanical way by how far back in a linear or branching causal chain one is able to go. While causal adequacy is about basic causal-explanatory satisfaction (going from effect back to immediate cause), causal history depth goes back further.

Explanatory depth comes in at least two varieties, depending upon whether it pertains primarily to events or laws. Causal history depth focuses on events. The second main variety of explanatory depth, which is law-focused, has been elucidated best in Hitchcock and Woodward's causal-counterfactual account of explanation, which is based on a particular sort of "range" or generality that is fundamentally different from unification.

Unification refers to "generality with respect to objects or systems other than the one that is the focus of explanation." Hitchcock-Woodward explanatory depth, by contrast, targets "range" in the sense of "generality with respect to *other possible properties of the very object or system that is the focus of explanation*"

Newton's account of free fall possessed more explanatory depth than Galileo's. Newton explained not just free fall very near earth's surface (the restricted range of Galileo's theory), but also free fall toward earth starting from any distance. Furthermore, Newton could explain free fall towards a hypothetically "altered earth", perhaps if there is a change in its mass and radius, or if one works with another planet or a star. So the Newtonian explanation of free fall remains invariant through a larger range of investigator interventions.

In short, Newton's "free fall" account is explanatorily deeper than Galileo's because it handles a larger range of counterfactual questions about the *same kind of  phenomena* (free fall in various circumstances). Of course, Newton's physics (three laws of motion and universal gravitation) explain many *other kinds* of phenomena beyond free fall about which Galileo was silent, but that constitutes the taxonomically disparate theoretical virtue of unification, not explanatory depth.

Notice the progression within the evidential theoretical virtues from achieving a basic evidential fit (evidential accuracy), to identifying a minimally complete causal story (causal adequacy), and finally to deepening the explanation of the evidence in either an event-event or law-like way. Each additional virtue builds upon the previous ones, with evidential accuracy at the foundation.

### Evidential theoretical virtues in the light of theories of explanation
One doesn't need to endorse any of the three leading accounts of explanation, causal-mechanical, causal counterfactual, or unification views, in order to glean insight from this discussion to better understand several theoretical virtues

The prima facie epistemic priority of evidence in theory choice contribute to the rationale for treating the evidential theoretical virtues first in the taxonomy. First place signifies epistemic priority for evidential virtues in theory formation and theory choice.

## Coherential Theoretical Virtues
---
### Internal consistency
Internal consistency is exhibited in a theory when its components are not contradictory. Douglas considers internal consistency to be a minimal criteria of a theory. Evidential accuracy is also part of the minimal criteria of a theory.

Vicker's argues that almost all purported examples of internal inconsistency in science fail to meet appropriate inconsistency crieria, chiefly:
1. jointly employed propositions
2. that are thought to be true rather than approximations or idealizations
3. that involve a contradiction.

When internal inconsistency does occur, it isn't noticed until someone sees that a contradiction is derivable from jointly employed propositions.

### Internal coherence
Internal coherence is possessed by a theory whose components are coordinated into an intuitively plausible whole. This virtue constitutes a kind of coherence that is more subtle and extensive than the logical principles of internal consistency. 

Schindler in his analysis of Mendeleev's periodic table as an especially internally coherent classification theory of elements (despite its initial lack of evidential fit with a few "known" elements), notes that internal coherence evades definition by necessary and sufficient conditions. However, it can be described using clear cases.

Consider the negative (vice) formulation of internal coherence: a theory lacks internal coherence to the extent that it incorporated as hoc hypotheses.  This typically refers to the construction of a theoretical component (hypothesis) that is attached to a theory in order to solve an isolated problem, but which is illegitimate in one or more other respects. Illegitimacy criteria include: It is insufficiently testable (e.i., too imprecise), it explains no other significant facts beyond the data that prompted its construction, and its "fit" within the larger theory is to some degree conceptually incoherent, awkward, arbitrary, or superficial.

Recent analysis of the status of ad hoc hypotheses range widely from articulating the relative clarity of ad hocness by means of surveying obvious cases of inadequate science or pseudoscience, to arguing that the designation "ad hoc" is hopelessly subjective.

Hunt argues for the latter by reference to historical cases in which participants in specific theoretical disputes disagreed on what counts as ad hoc, and situations in which allegedly past clear cases of ad hocery were later reinterpreted to not be ad hoc due to subsequent discoveries.

### Universal coherence
Universal coherence is present if a theory sits well with, or is not obviously contrary to, other warranted beliefs. If a theory is at odds with other well established knowledge, then all the worse for that theory. Incoherence in one's belief system indicates something is wrong. 

A prominent example of a scientific theory that scored low in this virtue was the steady state theory, which rivaled big bang cosmology before the stunning success of the latter in the second half of the twentieth century. Steady state theory posited the continual creation of new matter in order to maintain constant average density throughout an allegedly eternal universe. Such an idea was commonly taken to be in conflict with the scientific understanding of the conservation of matter-energy, not to mention the strong metaphysical intuitions and arguments that stood behind such conservation laws in science.

The coherential theoretical virtues express how theoretical components fit together well, and they do so in a progressively expansive manner. Internal consistency is about logical rigor. Internal coherence concerns a broader sense of coherence: a theory whose components are coordinated into an intuitively plausible whole. Finally, universal coherence refers to a theory that sits well within one's total knowledge.

The first three classes of theoretical virtues—evidential, coherential, and aesthetic—are arranged in decreasing order of epistemic weight. The aesthetic theoretical virtues may carry no *intrinsic* epistemic value. By this we mean the aesthetic properties of theories might not:
1. indicate the likely attainment of approximate truth
2. be a requirement for truth.

while the evidential and coherential virtues are widely understood to be of intrinsic epistemic value.

## Aesthetic Theoretical Virtues
---
Aesthetic theoretical virtues possess an aesthetic shape (*fittingness*) that is qualitatively different from the logical-conceptual *fit* of coherential virtues.

Scholars in many fields appeal to the aesthetic properties of theories in their case for accepting such theories. However, the epistemic status of the aesthetic virtues has been challenged more than that of any other virtue. Besides beauty and simplicity, which are the most frequently purported aesthetic theoretical virtues, we'll also argue that unification belongs to the aesthetic class of virtues.

### Beauty as the most general aesthetic theoretical virtue
A beautiful theory evokes aesthetic pleasure in properly functioning and sufficiently informed persons. The properties of theories and mathematical proofs that are among those factors that trigger the experience of beauty include symmetry, aptness, and surprising inevitability.

In contrast, aesthetic relativism suggests that no judgments about beauty or ugliness are more correct than others. If this view of aesthetics were correct, it's difficult to see how aesthetic theoretical virtues could be of rational importance in theory choice.

Some argue that all aesthetic evaluative properties of theories are grounded in the non-aesthetic evaluative properties of theories such as internal consistency, internal coherence, universal coherence, explanatory power, and simplicity. 

Scientists, mathematicians, and other scholars sometimes appeal to their aesthetic engagement with theories in order to help justify theory choice. Dirac, one of the founders of quantum mechanics, celebrated general relativity's elegance.

> The foundations of the theory are, I believe, stronger than what one could get simply from the support of experimental evidence. The real foundations come from the great beauty of the theory…. It is the essential beauty of the theory which I feel is the real reason for believing in it.

McCartney expresses the affinities of the three major aesthetic theoretical virtues as seen in physics.

> Anyone who has dealt with Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism, or the Schrödinger equation, cannot fail to be impressed with the concise elegance of the formulae. Their compact beauty is made all the more stark when one considers the very broad range of phenomena they ultimately explain and encapsulate.

Beauty and its two most epistemically important special cases of simplicity and unification are vividly displayed here in their mutual relations. 

Although generic theoretical beauty might have no intrinsic epistemic value, it more likely possesses extrinsic epistemic value to the extent that such a general aesthetic experience inclines researchers toward recognizing and cultivating simplicity and unification as special kinds of beauty that are more epistemically relevant in theory choice.

### Simplicity and Unification as specific complementary aesthetic theoretical virtues
A theory that exhibits simplicity explains the *same facts* as rival theories, but with *less* theoretical content. A unified theory, however, is one that explains *more kinds of facts* than rival theories with the *same* amount of theoretical content.

Simplicity and unification address the same thing, the style of informativeness, from opposite complementary orientations. Simplicity is increased informative by means of comparative *reduction* (relative to rival theories) of theoretical content. Unification is increased informativeness by means of a comparative *increase* in the different kinds of data that get explained. A theory can be evaluated for its informativeness in proportion to its theoretical content in both stylistic directions.

Such comparative evaluations may be difficult to characterize formally due to their subtlety. However, in the case of simplicity, "less theoretical content" means, roughly, fewer entities postulated by theory (often called parsimony or ontological simplicity) and/or fewer or more concise basic theoretical principles (often called elegance or syntactic simplicity).

Many versions of simplicity have been identified and they include factors such as a theory that: postulates fewer entities, postulates fewer kinds of entities, raises fewer additional explanatory questions, and posits fewer primitive explanatory ideas.  Swinburne adds: postulates fewer laws and postulates law relating fewer variables. McAllister observes that this multiplicity of simplicity criteria, many of which might be relevant to a particular theoretical dispute, defies complete reduction to quantified evaluative procedures such as those Sober and Kelly propose.

Sober recommends simplicity as a consideration in theory choice if it is understood as the number of adjustable model parameters as treated within either the Bayesian or frequentist philosophical traditions of probability theory. In short, he considers the aesthetic value of simplicity to be merely subjective and irrelevant to the epistemic value of simplicity. Sober aims to show that simplicity helps scholars to infer which explanation is best, even if reality is not structured by beautiful simple principles. Several (but not all, says Sober) of the mathematically rigorous treatments of simplicity “agree that parsimony as measured by the number of adjustable parameters in a model, is relevant to making … estimates” of either a model’s predictive accuracy or its likelihood.

Forster and Sober concede here that many instances of unification are not captured by mathematical model selection procedures that might have reduced the rationality of favoring more unified theories to merely their higher predictive accuracy estimates.

DeLancey (2011) argues that the simplicity criterion in theory choice could operate reasonably whether or not the world is elegantly simple (and he does so in a manner that differs from Sober and Kelly).  After arguing that we have no reason to expect that the world’s potential complexity has any definite upper limit, DeLancey maintains that “simple” is a relative term, like “small.” So, for any magnitude of complexity “it’s reasonable to call it ‘simple,’ since there are infinitely many alternatives that are more complex”. This means that simplicity only operates comparatively with respect to rival theories. Huemer offers a similar account.

The boundary asymmetry analysis of simplicity—and its stated rarity of theoretical simplicity compared to theoretical complexity—is supportive of simplicity’s epistemic value.

Simplicity also overlaps with internal coherence. One way for a theory to score low in simplicity is by the presence of ad hoc hypotheses.

The fourth class of theoretical virtues possess a distinctive temporal dimensional that is missing in the three previous classes. The diachronic virtues come last because they cannot be instantiated in the initial framing of a theory. They require additional time *after* a theory is launched.

## Diachronic Theoretical Virtues
---
Durability, fruitfulness, and applicability can only be instantiated as a theory is cultivated after its origin. This necessarily extended temporal dimension of the diachronic virtues is, arguably of considerable epistemic importance.

### Durability
A theory exhibits durability if it has survived testing by successful prediction or by plausible accommodation of new unanticipated data (or both). Popular or long-lived theories are not necessarily durable in the epistemic sense in view here. Testability is a prerequisite for durability, but many testable theories have failed too many tests to be durable. The more testable a theory is, the more durable it would prove itself to be if it passes the tests.

Despite the important role of predictive success as a component of durability in many areas of science, it is less prominent in some reputable scientific theories that are, nevertheless, well endowed with other virtues. Successful historical theories very frequently show their durability by a track record of plausible accommodation of new data that, although not predicted, came to light after the theory’s origin. The durability of a theory suffers if one or more of its predictions are disconfirmed or when theorists respond to disconfirming evidence by modifying the theory with ad hoc hypotheses.

It is impossible for a newborn theory to instantiate the virtue of durability. A similar necessary temporal dimension characterizes fruitfulness.

### Fruitfulness
Fruitfulness, also known as fertility or fecundity, is another diachronic  theoretical virtue. A theory is fruitful if, over time, it generates additional discovery by means such as successful novel prediction, unification, and non ad hoc theoretical elaboration.

While durability is about conservation (a theory passing tests to survive), fruitfulness is about innovation (a theory stimulating further discovery). When a prediction formulated in the context of a theory’s construction is later verified, this successful predictive outcome increases the virtue of durability in that theory.

By contrast, a novel prediction is one that was not conceived in conjunction with a theory’s construction, but that nevertheless follows reasonably from it. When such a novel prediction is confirmed by observation, a theory exhibits fruitfulness.

The closely related diachronic character of durability and fruitfulness is well illustrated in the discovery of the first two planets beyond Saturn. Soon after Friedrich William Herschel unexpectedly discovered Uranus in 1781, astronomers noted that its observed motion strayed from what contemporary Newtonian mechanics predicted of such a planet. However, given the overall theoretically virtuous status of Newtonian physics up through that time (including its durability due to its success in testing), most astronomers expected a forthcoming way to make Uranus compliant with established theory.

Even rejecting the anomalous data as “inaccurate” seemed reasonable early on. By the 1830s, however, the possibility of a perturbing planet beyond Uranus became a more reasonable and popular speculation, despite the absence of a precise novel prediction of where to find such a planet. By this time many astronomers were modestly confident in the accumulated data of Uranus’ positions in the sky.

This brings us to the celebrated successful novel prediction of 1845–1846. Based principally on Newtonian physics and the well-known irregularities in Uranus’ motion, two astronomers independently predicted where another unknown perturbing planet (later called Neptune) was likely located. Le Verrier’s estimate of the planet’s location was the most accurate (correct within one degree), as confirmed by a German astronomer in 1846. The (fruitful) novel prediction of Neptune was born within the context of a *durable* Newtonian orbital mechanics research tradition and the unexpected discovery of Uranus with its anomalous motions. The sensational success of this novel prediction (the discovery of Neptune) also rendered Uranus a Newtonian-compliant planet—thus further vindicating earlier provisional toleration of Uranus’ anomalies, a toleration that had been justified by yet earlier Newtonian durability and fruitfulness.

One may be [[The Duhem Thesis and the Quine Thesis|surprised]] that the principal kind of question being tested was not “Do the calculated motions \[e.g., of Uranus] agree  with the observed motions?” (which is a question of durability). Rather it was: “Can robust physical sources compatible with Newtonian theory be found for each clear, systematic discrepancy between the calculated and the observed motions?” (which is a question of fruitfulness). Neptune (as novelly predicted) turned out to be such a robust physical source.

However scientists failed over a half century to find a robust (detectable) physical source for the Newtonian-defying behavior of Mercury—a tiny anomaly in the precession of its perihelion. But this failure, which Einstein solved by way of theory replacement, might not completely diminish the epistemic significance of two centuries of Newtonian durability and fruitfulness.

Such serial Newtonian problem solving shows an interlocking of durability (passing tests to survive) and fruitfulness (stimulating further discovery). For example, Uranus’ temporarily Newtonian-defying behavior “would have been masked if the significantly larger gravitational effects of Saturn on Uranus had not been included in the calculation first.”

#### *Unification as a mode of fruitfulness*
Fruitful theory elaboration, whether by means of successful novel prediction or non ad hoc theoretical elaboration that makes sense of unanticipated evidence, often also makes sense of new kinds of data, and thus is additionally recognized as increasing a theory’s unification.

The diachronic increase of unification differs somewhat from its non-diachronic cousin. William Whewell called diachronic unification "consilience." When a theory explains a new domain of facts in a surprising way, then it is fruitful in a consilient manner.

#### *The role of prediction in the diachronic virtues*
Drawing on the relationship of prediction to inferring the best explanation, predictions are valuable because they figure into all three of the major diachronic virtues (testing theories successfully), fruitfulness (expanding “our knowledge into new realms”), and applicability (which includes “gaining some measure of control over natural processes”). 

### Applicability
Applicability refers to when a theory is used to guide successful action or to enhance technological control. High degrees of the virtue of applicability obtain when a theory that is used to guide such action or control provides more effective outcomes than what is possible in the absence of the theory.

## The big picture that emerges from this theoretical virtue systematization
There are at least 12 major theoretical virtues and they are best classified into four categories: evidential, coherential, aesthetic, and diachronic. 

The evidential virtues which are about how well theoretical components correspond to events and regularities in the world, are to be distinguished from the coherential virtues, which pertain to how well theoretical components fit together. The aesthetic theoretical virtues possess an aesthetic shape (*fittingness*) that is quite different from the logical-conceptual fit of the coherential virtues. This deep divide is also reflected by the greater difficulty of establishing the epistemic value of aesthetic virtues compared to coherential virtues.

The first three classes of theoretical virtues are arranged in order of decreasing epistemic weight and each class contains at least three closely related virtues. The fourth class of theoretical virtues—the diachronic—entails a temporal dimension that is missing in the previous classes. The diachronic virtues can only be instantiated after a theory’s initial formulation—when it has had opportunity to be tested, elaborated, and applied.

Each virtue class contains at least three virtues that sequentially follow a repeating pattern of progressive disclosure and expansion.
