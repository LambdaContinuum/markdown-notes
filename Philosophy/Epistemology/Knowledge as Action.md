# What Constitutes a Fully Apt Performance
---
*Judgement and knowledge itself are forms of intentional action*. That is the thesis argued here. Such actions fall under a certain normative structure of success, competence, and aptness, or success that manifests competence. Judgment is a special case falling under that structure.

## *Actions and Performance*
Intentional actions come in two sorts. An attempt is an intentional action, an endeavor to attain a certain object.
1. An attempt can fail and remain a mere attempt.
2. An achievement is a certain sort of *successful* attempt.

If someone intentionally flips a switch in the endeavor to turn on a light, that is an *attempt*. If the attempt succeeds, then the agent does turn on the light by flipping that switch, which, if all goes well, is an *achievement*.

Intentional actions are one sort of performance. Some performances are also aimings, without being intentional. The heart aims by pumping to circulate an organisms blood, which it does without doing so intentionally. Such functional aimings also come int two sorts.
1. Failing and remaining mere aimings.
2. Successful aimings.

## *The AAA Structure*
We'll focus on (intentional) attempts.  These fall under the sort of normative structure that pertains, for example, to an archer's aim to hit a target.

The shot might hit its target, in which case it's accurate.

It might be competent: as the arrow leaves the bow, its speed and orientation derived from the archer's skill would, in normal conditions, take it to the bullseye. A shot can be accurate without being competent and competent without being accurate. 

But even a shot that is both accurate and competent might fall short in a further respect. Imagine a gust of wind might take the arrow of course, whereupon, a second gust might come along and put it back on course. That shot is then accurate and competent, but the accuracy is attributable not so much to the archer's competence as to the luck of the second gust. Such a shot then falls short in aptness. A shot is *apt* iff its success manifests the competence then exercised by the archer. Its *success* must manifest that competence. Real achievement requires not just success but aptness.

Here's the AAA structure which applies as follows to the shot:
- A shot is *accurate* iff it hits the target.
- A shot is *adroit* iff it is an exercise of competence.
- A shot if *apt* iff it is accurate because it is adroit.

Generalizing more generally to attemptsL
- An attempt is *successful* iff it attains its aim.
- It is *competent* iff it is an exercise of competence.
- It is *apt* iff it is successful because it is competent.

## *Epistemology as a Special Case*
Epistemology concerns a domain of *epistemic* performance, such as belief, judgement, inference, learning, inquiry, and so on.

We'll focus on the performance of judgement. Let's being with an example from athletic performance: the basketball shot on goal.
