How might we determine the conditions necessary and sufficient for the attainment of knowledge? What is knowledge?

# What is Knowledge?
---
A gambler rolling dice might be persuaded that the dice will come up 7 or 11 on his next toss, and he might be right. But he still wouldn't know. What *more* would he need in order to know, besides a belief that is true?

A good reason maybe?

At noon you may think it is noon based on reading a clock, but suppose the clock happened to stop at noon days ago. Even if you have excellent reason to trust that clock, you could hardly know the time that way.

You may believe that someone here owns a Ford because you have excellent reason to think that Nogot here owns one. Someone does indeed own a Ford, namely Havit, not Nogot.

Out for a ride in the country, you see a barn facade and of course take it that the structure you see is a real barn. However, nearly all the facades in the area are mere facades part of a movie set. (a facade can be a mere facade with no building behind it but it can also be just a side of a real building according to the dictionary).

In all of these cases you have a true belief and have ex hypothesi excellent reasons for believing, but you do not know. So even a true belief based on excellent reason may fall short of knowledge.

Perhaps we need not a true belief that has a good rational basis but rather one that is *sensitively* true. Here then is the proposal:

> [!box_name] *Sensitivity Condition:*
> In order for a true belief to be a case of knowledge, it must be *sensitive:* it must be one that the believer *would not* hold if its content were false rather than true.

This requirement is violated by the true believers in the examples given above. The clock reader would still believe that it was noon even if he were reading the clock at a time other than noon. You would still believe someone here owned a Ford, even if no one did. You would still believe that the structure you saw was a real barn even when that was not so, you simply saw a mere barn facade.

There is a further case in which one fails to know despite getting it right with good justification, as one expects correctly and justifiably to lose a lottery given the astronomically long odds. Here the subject plausibly believes based on a fine rational basis. Here again a true belief is widely assumed to fall short despite being based on such a rational basis. Moreover, the sensitivity condition ostensibly delivers the right result, because our subject's belief that his ticket will lose is insensitive: it would still be held by the believer, on the same probabilistic basis, even if, against all odds, as a matter of contingent fact the ticket would win.

The sensitivity condition is open to objections. But its undeniable intuitive attractiveness can be explained through an easily confused but far preferable notion of "safety".

Suppose we require sensitivity for knowledge and we agree with the following: *that any conclusion reached through competent deduction from something known to be true is also known to be true.*

Consider notorious skeptical scenarios such as *One's envatted brain is fed simulations that present a common-sense world of a familiar sort* or *An evil demon feeds one directly a natural course of common-sense experience.*

Consider in some such case one's belief in the ordinary surroundings that would normally correspond to such a course of experience. These experience-based beliefs fail to be sensitive.

Take next the belief that one is *not* in any such skeptical scenario. Any such belief would be insensitive and be disqualified by the sensitivity condition. So any belief you are not victimized fail to constitute knowledge even when you have competently deduced that conclusion. If you were a victim you would nonetheless believe you weren't the victim.,

Here is the implication. Consider the principle:
>[!box-name] (DK)
>Competent deduction transmits knowledge: anything believed as a conclusion based on competent deduction from known premises is also thereby known.

Given that principle, we cannot know such things as that we see a hand or perceive a fire. For if we could know such things, then from the premise that we do see the hand or the fire we could competently deduce that we are not relevantly victimized, and according to DK we would know that we're not victimized. But the sensitivity condition precludes us knowing that conclusion.

So we have a reductio: from
1. *the sensitivity condition*
2. the principle DK
3. the assumption that we are able to make such deduction

It follows we cannot know the world around us. However, this argument is itself best seen as a broader reductio, one that reduces to absurdity that sensitivity condition.

The problems found to affect sensitivity don't affect a closely related "safety". A belief is sensitive iff had it been false, S would not have held it, whereas a belief is *safe* iff S would not hold it without it being true.

If we opt for safety as the right requirement, then a common-sense stance is defensible from the *sensitivity-based* objections, which enables us to escape the route to skepticism. One does satisfy the requirement that one's belief of not-H be safe: after all, not easily would one believe that not-H without its being true.

In the actual world, and for quite a distance from the actual world, our belief that we are not radically deceived matches the fact as to whether we are or not radically deceived.

Here is a sketch of the preferred explanation.
1. It is safety that is required for knowledge, not sensitivity. It's required that $B(p) \to p$ and not that $\neg p \to \neg B(p)$, where $\to$ is a subjunctive conditional.
2. Take our belief that we are not radically deceived as in the skeptical scenario. Because that belief is safe, the skeptic cannot argue for his distinctive premise by alleging that we violate the safety requirement.
3. Safety and sensitivity, being mutual contrapositives, are easily confused, so it's easy to confuse the correct requirement of safety with a requirement for sensitivity. It's easy to overlook that subjunctive conditionals do no contrapose validly.
4. Those who find the skeptic's distinctive premise plausible on basis of sensitivity considerations may be confusing sensitivity with safety, as the requirement of safety is supported by the sorts of consideration adduced by the sensitivity-based opposition to G.E. Moore's commonsense standpoint. They're similar so it's easy to confuse.
5. The plausibility of the skeptic's sensitivity premise is explained compatibly with its falsity.

Let's step back and consider the methodology we've implicitly followed up until now. In doing so, we'll turn to the full account of knowledge that was once consensus. The thesis that knowledge is justified true belief.

# The Metaphysical Gettier Problem
---
Consider the schema "S knows that P" and further consider the following thesis:

>[!box_name] JTB
>Necessarily: S knows that p if and only if S has a justified true belief that p.

This thesis on its face is about neither language nor concepts (as psychological entities). It is a necessary biconditional about people or subjects.

If JTB is the target, then a Gettier counterexample postulates a case C about which it's plausible that both:
1. It is possible
2. It entails that someone has justified true belief without having knowledge.

This would refute JTB since if X both is possible and entails Y (such entailment has to be necessary, but the book doesn't say it), then Y is possible. So it's possible for someone to have justified true belief that p without knowing that p, which contradicts JTB.

We can discern three Gettier problems that are distinct.
1. A problem of *semantic* analysis: what is the semantic analysis of the linguistic expression "S knows that p"?
2. A problem of a certain sort of *conceptual* analysis: With concepts understood as meanings or as psychological entities. What is involved in someone's possession and/or deployment of a given concept? This problem concerns people's minds, their psychology, their mental states or the contents of those states.
3. A problem of *metaphysical* analysis: Our focus on an objective phenomenon that need be neither expression nor concept. Our focus is on a state that people host or an act that they perform. This is the phenomenon whose ontology we wish to understand. What is the nature of such a state or act, and how is it grounded? IN virtue of what is it actual when it is actual?

So we've arrived at three distinct theses concerning propositional knowledge:

>[!box_name] JTBm(odal)
>Necessarily: S knows that p if and only if S has a justified true belief that p.

>[!box_name] JTBe(xplanatory)
>Necessarily: Whenever S knows that p, S knows that p by (*in virtue of*) having a justified true belief that p, and whenever S has a justified true belief that p, S *thereby* knows that p.

>[!box_name] JTBc(onstitutional)
>Knowledge is (ontologically) constituted by justified true belief.

If JTBc can explain JTBe and JTBm, it enjoys additional explanatory payoff.
