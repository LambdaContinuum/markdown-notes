# Introduction

To claim that there is only one Tasmanian tiger, just showing one instance of the species wouldn't be enough. You must also show there is no other Tasmanian Tiger.

Likewise, when we consider arguments for the existence of God, we must clarify what needs to be shown. Is the term "God" understood as a general term much like the species of Tasmanian tigers or is it taken as a proper name?

If the former, it's better to write it as "god" to underline its difference from the proper name "God." The literature on the existence of God roughly since Kant seems insensitive to the distinction between god and God as outlined above.

In the *Critique of Pure Reason*, Kant classifies arguments for the existence of God into three main classes: [[On the very idea of an ontological proof|ontological]], cosmological, and teleological.

He offers criticisms of these arguments, yet the formulation of these arguments does not purport to establish that there is only one god. Kant's main task is to undermine our cognitive capacity to know that there is at least one god understood as an ultimate being beyond the phenomenal realm. Arguably, this historical and dialectical context that challenges the existence of any god could have clouded what requires for a full argument for the existence of God. In the endeavor to respond modern challenges, the main focus has shifted to divine existence, and the issue of divine uniqueness largely slipped attention.

Nonetheless, for monothesists, God is a unique being. It's still a burden on monotheists to complement their arguments for God with additional steps to justify the uniqueness claim.

We'll reconstruct an argument for divine uniqueness from the Islamic kalam tradition. It is known as "mutual hindrance by two omnipotent beings". There are different versions and formulations of this argument. Al-Ghazali's version has been picked up in the contemporary literature. There have been various reconstructions, but we'll focus on the modal version of this argument, which is called "the argument from possible conflict among gods," as proposed by Al-Taftazani.

First, we shall outline the general structure of the kalam arguments for the existence of God. Next, we'll present al-Taftzani's argument and update it by possible world semantics. Finally, we'll consider three significant objections and respond to them.

# An Outline of the Kalam Way of Arguing for the Existence of God
---
Arguments in Kalam typically rely on an inference from the existence and various features of the universe to the existence of God. They do not proceed via some ontological type of the argument that aims to establish the existence of God from the concept of God.

In this reasoning, one "proceeds from a visible effect to an invisible cause" (*istidlāl bil-shāhid ʿalā l-ghā’ib*). This type of arguing has three main steps:
1. Arguments for the existence of an eternal or necessary being,
2. Arguments to establish that the eternal or necessary being in question is a personal or volitional agent having some attributes such as omnipotence, omniscience, and will essentially,
3. arguments for the uniqueness of this personal being who is eternal or necessary.

All these steps collectively constitute an argument for the existence of God. Thus, it would be proper to consider these steps as part of a meta-argument.

In the first step, some scholars, especially the pre-Ghazalian ones initially try to establish that the universe has a beginning. Next they argue that there must be an eternal (*qadīm*) being response for this origination as the ultimate cause. It's been noted that being eternal entails that it is a necessary being (*wājib al-wujūd*). With multiple ways to argue for the origination of the universe, this type of argument is generally known as "the kalam cosmological argument" as popularized by William Lane Craig. It would b better to modify this title as "the kalam cosmological argument from temporal origination" as there is another widespread type of cosmological argument in kalam.

Scholars, especially that come later after al-Ghazali, propose arguments that start with contingent beings. Without need to establish the origination of the universe, they infer the existence of a necessary being from the contingent beings. Let's call this type of argument, "the kalam cosmological argument from contingency" (*dalīl al-imkān*).

Al-Taftazani uses both type of cosmological arguments, that from temporal origination and that from contingency. He notes that the latter comes from Hellenic philosophers (*falāsifa*) and gives special attention to the former. 

In the second step, kalam scholars aim to show that the eternal or necessary being in question has certain attributes that are peculiar to person beings. The most important properties in this list are power, will, and knowledge, which are intimately related to each other. These attributes are regarded as eternal and thus essential to the eternal or necessary being established at the first step. And they are also regarded as sufficient to characterize it as a personal being and a volitional agent. In order to make this point, scholars typically appeal to certain features of the universe. 

They typically use teleological types of arguments to show that eternal or necessary being possesses knowledge. 

The temporal origination of the universe, the variety of finite beings and processes in the universe as well as some other features of contingency are used to show that eternal or necessary being has will.

The causality of this ultimate being could be regarded as power since it is under the guidance of will and knowledge.

Another significant aspect of this step is that scholars try to show that the attributes in question don't have finite scope. We cannot ascribe a limited power to a necessary being. Divine attributes have maximal scopes. They argue for the maximality of the scope by appealing to a fundamental principle related to the aforementioned analysis of contingency. Anything that admits alternatives or degrees requires an explanation. Since admitting degree or alternatives is a mark of contingency, they must be determined by something else. Since an eternal or a necessary being is an ultimate being, it is not under determination by any external being. Thus, divine attributes must have maximal scopes. Otherwise, they would have to be determined by something else.

Al-Taftazani considers the necessarily existent creator to be living, powerful, knowing, hearing, seeing, desiring, and willing. He appeals to some kind of teleological argument to justify this claim. He notes that the creator in question cannot be devoid of these attributes since lack of them would be defects that would contravene the perfection of the creator. He considers this creator to be omniscient and omnipotent because lack of them in any degree requires a cause that determines the degree in question. In such a case, the creator would be under influence, which is contrary to this perfection.

In the third step, kalam scholars try to show the uniqueness of the creator.

# Al-Taftazani on Arguments from Mutual Hindrance among Gods
---
Al-Taftazani presents to versions of mutual hindrance among gods. The first relies upon the assumption that gods would conflict in actuality. We can call this version "the argument from actual conflict among gods." Al-Taftanzi considers this argument to be convincing, but admits that this version is open to objections. It's possible that gods may agree on the present visible order. There is a stronger argument that blocks this possibility. That version of MHA relies only on the possible conflict among gods. Gods do not have to oppose each other in actuality but they can oppose each other. This version is "the argument from possible conflict among gods."

Al-Taftazani considers somebody called "Zayd." Now, assume that there are two necessary beings who are omnipotent. Being omnipotent means that their powers apply to all possible situations. Their powers are controlled by their wills, and thus their wills apply to all possible cases. When an omnipotent being wills such a possible situation to take place, it must happen. One such being, call it "N1", could will Zayd to move and the other, call it "N2", could will Zayd to lie down to rest. Either Zayd's moving or being at rest are possible and fall within the scope of power or will. However, Zayd's moving and being at rest at the same time and under the same conditions are contrary to each other and thus not possible.

There are the following alternatives
1. Zayd both moves and lies at rest. Since this is impossible, this is ruled out.
2. Zayd moves. Then the wish of N1 is realized but the wish of N2 is not. If N2 wills something possible but could not make it happen, then N2 is not omnipotent.
3. Zayd lied at rest. Then the wish of N2 is realized but the wish of N1 is not. Ergo, N1 Is not omnipotent.

In any case, there is only one omnipotent being. There could not be more than one. Thus, given that there is at least one necessary being that is also omnipotent, then there is only one such being. Hence, God is unique. A fortiori God exists.

# Analyzing and Updating Al-Taftazani's Argument from Possible Conflict among Gods
---
Let's formulate the argument in terms of possible world semantics.  (RTA)

Target conclusion: There is at most one necessary being who possesses omnipotent will.
1. Assume that there are more than one such being. Call them N1 and N2 (Assumption for reductio).
2. N1 is omnipotent.
3. N2 Is omnipotent.
4. S is a contingent state of affairs (i.e. S is possible and ~S is possible).
5. S falls under the scope of N1's power. N1 could wish S to obtain in all possible worlds and could realize (from 2).
6. ~S falls under the scope of N2's powers. N2 could wish ~S to obtina in all possible worlds and could realize it. (from 3).
7. Let W be the possible world in which N1 wishes S to obtain and could realize it, but N2 wishes ~S to obtain and could realize it.
8. S and ~S could not obtain in the same possible world, thus in W (S and ~S leads to a contradiction in W).
9. Assuming that both N1 and N2 are omnipotent leads to a contradiction. Thus both N1 and N2 cannot be omnipotent.
10. Both N1 and N2 are omnipotent.
11. 9 and 10 are contradictory.
12. there 1 is false.

# Objections
---
## The Possibility of Agreement between the Omnipotent Volitions
The first objection considered is the possibility of agreement between the omnipotent volitions in question. N1 and N2 could agree on certain things. For instance, they both wish S to obtain in a possible world. They could agree to realize the same universe up to all its details.

The response is obvious.
1. The possibility of agreement is irrelevant to RTA
2. If we accept the possibility of agreement, it isn't clear how the powers of different necessary beings would collaborate to realize the same thing.

To extend the first point, let's accept that the wills of N1 and N2 perfectly agree on everything in a possible world called "W1". But this case does not pose any challenege. Whether there are such worlds is irrelevant. The argument aims to find a counterexample, providing an example doesn't refute it. You'd have to prove they agree on all worlds.

## What if the Omnipotent Beings have Necessarily Compatible Volitions?
If it's impossible that omnipotent beings could ever conflict, then it's possible to avoid the conclusion of RTA. Two omnipotent beings could co-exist without having a possible conflict between their wills.

Divine will can be analyzed in terms of two levels or dimensions. The first level concerns to what divine will is potentially related, which is basically all the logically or metaphysically possible states of affairs. The second level concerns to what divine will is actually related. Perhaps their wills are necessarily rendered compatible in choosing what to realize in actuality. Their wills are determined somehow to be compatible.

The way the wills of omnipotent beings are determined to be compatible is either contingent or necessary. If it contingent, then the possibility of conflict between their wills it not lost. This is sufficient for RTA to work. If the wills of omnipotent beings are determined to be compatible necessarily, we need to investigate the conditions under which this scenario holds so we can evaluate them one by one.

Let's consider external reasons. Let us reconsider N1 and N2 as two independent, omnipotent necessary beings. They are ultimate beings. Thus, it is not the case that some greater beings could determine their will. They are also independent beings, different from each other. We can conceive of three scenarios:
1. N1 determines the will of N2
2. N2 determines the will of N1
3. N1 and N2 come to an agreement through a pact or something.

(1) and (2) render one of the necessary beings in question incapable of sustaining its independence, making it weaker than the other. Thus there is only 1.

In 3, coming to an agreement doesn't imply necessity on the sides of the agreement.

Let's consider whether they can be internal reasons, that explain why N1 and N2 necessarily have compatible wills. The most plausible reason would appeal to divine perfection to ground an omnipotent will that is determined internally.

In this scenario, a necessary being is assumed to be absolutely perfect. As a result of its perfection, it wills the best possible world order to realize in actuality. The necessary being, in Ibn Sina's view, knows the most perfect order. His knowledge in turn determines his will and power towards that order, and the universe conceived as manifesting the most perfect order emanated from the necessary being accordingly. Likewise, Leibniz's God creates the best possible world because God knows it as the best possible world and His perfection determines His will to create it. Divine nature delimits divine will towards  single option. As a result, two omnipotent beings that have such a nature necessarily have the same volition over the same things. If there is no possibility of conflict between divine wills, then RTA does not work.

In response Wainwright states that the possibility of conflict is intimately related to distinct personalities. Having a will that could possibly conflict with another will is a necessary condition for being a distinct person. If two wills cannot possible conflict, then the distinct personality of beings having those wills seems to be threatened.

What if our universe has arbitrary features which are irrelevant to its perfection?

Al-Ghazali makes this point in criticizing the cosmological system of the Neo-platonic philosophers. In their system, the world is at the center of the universe and there are entwined spheres revolving around it. The highest sphere moves from east to west and what is beneath it in the opposite direction. Al-Ghazali asks why the highest sphere moves from east to west rather than the other way. How is this feature related to the perfection of this cosmological system? There would be no difference. We can identify arbitrary features in any model of cosmological systems.

As a result, even if two omnipotent necessary beings necessarily will the most perfect order, their will could still differ from each other because of the arbitrary features inherent in this perfect order.

## Impossible Tasks do not fall under the scope of Divine Power
If two omnipotent beings disagree on something, they can block each other's power. Thus, the task on which they disagree becomes impossible for them to realize. Since impossibilities do not fall within the scope of divine power, as round squares do not fall, their omnipotence isn't threatened.
