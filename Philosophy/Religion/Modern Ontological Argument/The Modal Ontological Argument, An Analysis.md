# General Structure of the MOA
---
The MOA proceeds from God's [[Meaning, Modality, and Possible Worlds Semantics|possible]] existence to God's actual existence. Different variants exist though they typically share four parts:

1. The first part is a characterization of the being to be argued for.
	- Some MOAs focus on a *maximally great being*, where a being is maximally great if and only if it exists necessarily and is essentially omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect
	- Other MOAs focus on a *perfect being*, where a being is perfect if and only if it essentially possesses every perfection and essentially lacks every imperfection
		- Intuitively, perfections are *great-making features to their optimal extent*, which is typically their *maximal* extent. Some plausible examples of perfections include omnipotence or being *all*-powerful, omniscience or being  all-knowing, etc.
	- Other MOAs focus simply on God.
	- The precise characterization at play influences the justification of the second and third parts.

2. The second part is the *possibility premise* , which asserts that the characterized being is metaphysically possible.
	- Think of metaphysical possibility as what really could have obtained in reality. 
	- Metaphysical possibility is different from epistemic possibility. Something is epistemically possible for someone when it might, for all they know, be true. It isn't ruled out by their knowledge.
	- Metaphysical possibility is different from physical possibility. Something is physically possible when it's consistent with the laws of nature. But we might think that it's really possible for the laws of nature to have been different.
	- Metaphysical possibility is different from logical possibility. Something is logically possible just in case it's not self-contradictory or logically inconsistent. It's logically impossible for dogs to both exist and not exist, since that is a contradiction.  Water is essentially H20, it couldn't have been H30, for then it wouldn't be water it would be some other type of chemical compound. So, water being H30 is not metaphysically possible. But it is logically possible, since it's not logically inconsistent or contradictory.
	- Metaphysical possibility is the broadest or most inclusive alethic, non-epistemic, non-deontic objective modality that is insensitive to the guises under which things are presented.

3. The third part is the *necessity premise*, which asserts that the characterized being would be a *metaphysically necessary being*, in any possible world in which the being exists, it is necessary that said being exists.

4. The fourth part is a [[Necessity and Possibility|modal logic]] that:
	1. accurately captures or represents metaphysical modality
	2. strong enough to validate inferences from the possible necessary existence of x to the necessary existence of x.\
	- Modal logic is the study of valid inferences concerning possibility and necessity.
		- Logic is the study of valid inference, that is, the study of what follows from what?
		- Modality refers to the way in which something exists or the way in which something is true.
-  The system of modal logic that we use to run the MOA should accurately capture or accurately represent metaphysical modality. Typically used is system S5, but weaker systems like B have been used well.

# The representative argument
---
[[Norman Malcolm & Charles Hartshorne's Argument|A standard and representative formulation of the MOA]] runs as follow, with God as our characterized being and S5 as our Modal Logic:
1. Possibly, God exists. (Possibility premise)
2. Necessarily, if God exists, then it is necessary that God exists. (Necessity premise)
3. So it is necessary that God exists. (1, 2, S5)

Notice the four general parts:
1. The characterized being is God
2. The possibility premise is (1)
3. The necessity premise is (2)
4. The modal logic is S5

According to (2), it's true in any possible world in which God exists that it is necessary that God exists. According to (1), there's some possible world in which God exists. From (1) and (2) it follows that there's some possible world in which it is necessary that God exists. By the characteristic axiom of S5 $\Diamond\Box P \to \Box P$, it's necessary that God exists.

# A simpler variant
---
1. God's existence is possible. (Possibility premise)
2. God's existence is either necessary or impossible. (Necessity premise)
3. So, God's existence is necessary. (1, 2)

Technically speaking this argument doesn't need S5 to be valid, although the motivation for 2 arguably needs to appeal to a system like B or S5. Merely from defining that God is a necessary being, you don't get premise 2, but you could in B or S5.

Having covered this simpler variant, let's go over some criticisms.
# Criticisms
---
There are three ways to challenge the MOA in its representative form, each corresponding to the final three parts of the general structure of the MOA.

1. One can challenge the inference from (1) and (2) to (3) by challenging whether the modal logic underlying the argument accurately captures metaphysical modality.
2. One can challenge the necessity premise. While some characterizations of the being in question render the premise definitionally true, others require substantive argumentation. For example, if the characterization at play is *perfect being*, then the MOA proponent must argue that *necessary existence* is a perfection. If the being at play is God, then the MOA proponent must justify the claim that God would be a necessary being if he exists. Some philosophers, like Swinburne, have challenged the necessity premise, arguing that God would actually be contingent.
3. We'll largely focus on the third way, challenging the possibility premise. This strategy takes two forms.
	1. One could argue that the characterized being is metaphysically impossible. Not all these arguments are for God's impossibility, but many are, for instance, pretty much any of the a priori arguments, any of the arguments about conflicting divine attributes, any of the arguments about incoherent individual divine attributes, and so on. Any argument for God's actual non-existence is thereby an argument for God's possible non-existence.
	2. One could argue that the possibility premise hasn't been adequately justified, and so the proponent of the MOA simply hasn't met their argumentative burden; they have not justified their conclusion that God exists.
	- Notice these two strategies correspond to giving rebutting defeaters and undercutting defeaters for the premise, respectively. 

Falling into this second strategy under this third way to challenge the MOA is perhaps the most important objection to the MOA: the symmetry problem.

To draw out this problem, consider the following *Reverse MOA (RMOA)*:

1. * Possibly, God doesn't exist.
2. Necessarily, if God exists, then it's necessary that God exists.
3. * Hence, it is necessary that God doesn't exist (1*, 2)

Like the MOA, the RMOA is valid in S5. And notice that the same sort of reverse MOA crops up for the simpler variant presented earlier.

1. God's non-existence is possible.\
2. God's existence is either necessary or impossible.
3. So God's existence is impossible.

This argument is valid as well. Notice that the conclusions of the MOA and RMO contradict, yet the share the same second premise. That means there respective first premises are incompatible. And yet, they seem to be epistemically on par, it seems intolerably arbitrary to privilege one over the other absent further considerations. What's needed is some principled reason favoring one over the other, i.e., a consideration that *breaks symmetry* between them. *Absent* such a symmetry breaker, however, the MOA is dialectically toothless. If you don't already accept the claim that God exists, you won't agree that 1 is more acceptable than RMOA's 1 absent some symmetry breaker. 

So with no symmetry breaker the MOA makes no headway in the dispute between theist and non-theist. Without a symmetry breaker, the MOA simply fails. It gives no good reason to think God exists, for there would be no good reason to prefer 1 over the RMOA's 1.

The natual solution to the smmetry problem is to offer a symmetry breaker favoring 1 over the RMOA's 1.

Categorization problems arise here however, many such symmetry breakers appeal to premises that aren't *a priori*, and so they threaten the MOA's status as a properly *ontological* argument. Furthermore, even if they only appear to *a priori* premises, symmetry breakers may represent distinct ontological arguments in their own right.
# Symmetry breakers
---
Symmetry breakers have two parts:
1. First, it's argued that satisfying conditions, C, lend credence to metaphysical possibility
	- Lends credences to: entails, probabilifies, provides a defeasible presumption of, or constitutes non-negligible evidence for.\
2. Second, it's argued that <God exists\> satisfies C whereas <God doesn't exist\> does not.

Three general questions are therefore relevant for assessing symmetry breakers:
1. First, does the satisfaction of C lend credence to metaphysical possibility?
2. Second, does <God exists\> satisfy C?
3. Third, does <God doesn't exist\> satisfy C?

A symmetry breaker succeeds only if the first and second questions are answered *yes* while the third is answered *no*. Objections to symmetry breakers generally challenge one or more of these answers.

What follows will be a tour of symmetry breakers and objections thereto. Going forward (1) will refer to the original possibility premise, whereas (1*) refers to the reverse possibility premise.

## Presumption of possibility
*The symmetry breaker*. Leibniz famously said "We have the right to presume the possibility of every being, and especially that of God, until some one proves to the contrary". Hence, we should accept (1) unless given reason to reject it.

The idea here is that there's always a presumption that something is possible unless and until we have been given grounds for thinking it's impossible.

*Objections.*
1. It seems equally legitimate to presume the possible *non-existence* of any being unless given good reason to think it's necessary that such being exists. But then we are equally entitled to presume (1*), and symmetry is restored.

2. It's not clear why we should take such a freewheeling approach to modality. Why not instead adopt agnosticism about modal claims, especially highly theoretical ones very removed from our ordinary experience, unless given reason to think they're true? It seems to me we should simply suspend judgement on whether the entity in question is possible.

3. Sobel points out this presumption leads to inconsistent presumptions. Consider a [[Other Anselmian Argument|KnowNo]]. In fact, consider any entity whose possibility entails (1*) and this presumption will entail a contradiction.

## Conceivability
*The symmetry breaker.* God's existence is conceivable, and conceivability is evidence for metaphysical possibility. Hence, conceivability supports (1).

*Objections.* 
1. The most serious problem is that God's non-existence also seems conceivable, and hence symmetry isn't broken after all. Moreover, even if God's non-existence isn't directly conceivable, other things incompatible with God's existence seem conceivable, like KnowNos.

2. It's worth noting that it's controversial whether conceivability is good evidence for possibility. 

3. Those in the apophatic tradition may reject that God is even conceivable. Perhaps God is so transcendent or wholly other that he cannot be conceived. At least under some prominent accounts of conceivability which understand conceivability as a kind of sensory imaginability, it seems correct that God's existence is not conceivable because God doesn't have sensory qualities like color, shape, sound, taste, etc. that are the objects of sensory imagination.

## Deontic
*The symmetry breaker.* God is defined as a most perfect being. But a most perfect being ought to exist. So, God ought to exist. But what *ought* to be the case is *possibly* the case as 'Ought' implies 'can'. Hence, God possibly exists.

*Objections.*
1. It doesn't seem true in general that 'ought' implies 'can'. (I don't find any of his examples plausible).

2. It's not clear that 'oughts' are even applicable to non-agential contexts. That is, in contexts where $x$ isn't under any agent's control, it's not clear how it could be that $x$ ought to be the case. Relevant here is a distinction between *deontic properties*, properties of obligation and permission, and *evaluative properties*, properties of value and disvalue. While evaluative properties are plausibly instantiatable in non-agential contexts, it's contestable whether deontic properties can be instantiated in such contexts. If deontic properties are inapplicable to non-agential contexts, then it's not true that God ought to exist as there is no agent with the power to bring about or prevent God's existence. A reply to this worry might appeal to our ordinary and seemingly meaningful practices of attributing deontic properties in non-agential contexts. But such attributions are often either implicitly or explicitly *evaluative* in nature, and those that aren't are perhaps best interpreted as such.

3. Even supposing that deontic properties are applicable to non-agential contexts, it's not clear whether non-agential *oughts* imply corresponding *possibilities*. Consider non-agential 'oughts' concerning what's possible. One might find it plausible that what's possible *ought to be different* in various ways, perhaps there ought be no possible world in which holocausts occur, or in which conscious creatures suffer horrors, or what have you. If S5 captures metaphysical modality, what's possible *could not have been different*, if something is possible then it's necessarily possible. Thus, one might reasonably reject that non-agential 'oughts' imply corresponding possibilities.

4. Even supposing that non-agential oughts imply corresponding possibilities, those antecedently inclined to reject God's possibility will likewise reject that God ought to exist. But then affirming that God ought to exist seems dialectically inappropriate. If you don't already accept that God is possible, then you won't agree that God ought to exist, precisely because God ought to exist only if God is possible.

5. In saying that God ought to exist, the deontic symmetry breaker seems to assume *pro-theism*, according to which things would be overall better if God exists compared to if God doesn't exist. Pro-theism is controversial, and so the symmetry breaker's success is hostage to settling the pro/anti-theism debate in its favor.

6. The non-theist can claim that some x incompatible with God's existence ought to exist. Since per the symmetry breaker oughtness implies possibility, x is thereby possible. But since x is incompatible with God's existence, it follows that God's non-existence is possible. Symmetry is therefore restored. Some examples are UniNon's like the Neo-Platonic One. There are competing ought claims that are incompatible with each other.


## Ontomystical
*The symmetry breaker.* Samkara's Principle (SP) states that whatever is presented to a conscious subject in a phenomenal (or broadly perceptual) experience is metaphysically possible. Even if the experience is not veridical, its contents are at least possible says the SP. But many mystics have had phenomenal experiences as of a maximally great being. Hence, a maximally great being is possible.

*Objections.*
1. It's not clear how to differentiate phenomenal experiences from other sorts of experiences, this may hinder our ability to assess and justify SP.

2. There seems to be counterexamples to SP, some of which serve dually to restore symmetry between (1) and (1*). Assume Kripke, Putnam, et al. are correct in their claim that there are some empirical truths which are necessary truths, including the truth that *water* is H2O. It's no trouble to imagine the following scenario involving Sam, who we will suppose discovered that water is H2O. Just prior to discovering that water is H2O, Sam looked through his miscroscope at the molecular structure of water. There was a slight film on his lens which caused it to seem as if the molecular structure of water is in fact H3O. It really seemed to Sam that water is H3O. Thus, by Samkara's principle, it's possible that water is H3O. But, according to our supposition, it's not possible that water is H3O. So, we must reject Samkara's principle. Another objection is that many mystics have claimed to had phenomenal experiences as of *identity* with God or Ultimate Reality, but, plausibly, mystics are necessarily distinct from God and Ultimate reality. Many Hindu mystics seem to have phenomenally experienced identity with Brahman, while many Buddhist mystics seem to have phenomenally experienced an ultimate reality that isn't a supreme being at all. This restores the symmetry between (1) and (1*) since together with SP they imply that possibly, ultimate reality is not a maximally great being, which in turns entails the possible non-existence of a maximally great being. All this while also serving as a counter-example to SP.

3.  Humans aren't terribly reliable at correctly identifying experiences of *modal* properties, which may undercut the symmetry breaker's reliance on the claim that mystics have experienced a *maximally great being*, where *maximal greatness by definition includes the modal property of necessary existence*.

4. It's dubious that mystics have had experiences as of a *maximally great being*. It's dubious that mystics can *phenomenologically* differentiate between
	1. experiencing an essentially omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect being that exists in all possible worlds.
	2. experiencing an essentially omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect being that exists in all but one remote possible world.
	similarly it's dubious that they can *phenomenologically* differentiate between an omnipotent being and a nearly omnipotent being.

5.  Many argue that mystical experiences are more amorphous and less content specific than Pruss's characterization lets one. Characterizing the object of such experiences as *God* or a *maximally great being* is to invoke background theological beliefs and read them into the experience. One is thus giving an interpretation of the experiences which goes beyond what the phenomenological content of the experience itself warrants.

6. There may be phenomenal experiences as of God's *absence* or non-existence, or something that plausibly implies God's non-existence. Thus restoring symmetry.

## Motivated Centrality
*The symmetry breaker.* If belief that *p* is motivationally central to the flourishing and intellectually sophisticated lives of individuals and communities, then, probably, *p* is possible. But belief in a maximally great being has been motivationally central in precisely this way. So probably a maximally great being is possible.

*Objections.* 
1. Oppy convincingly shows there are serious challenges to the arguments proffered on behalf of the principle that proposition p's motivational centrality to flourishing and intellectually sophisticated lives make probable p's possibility;.

2. In light of the plenitude of impossible beliefs that are motivationally central to flourishing lives, it's not clear that motivational centrality to flourishing lives makes probable possibility. The world's religions seem to make countless claims about the essential character of things-ultimate reality, consciousness, the self, death, morality, and so on. Many such claims form the motivational centers of flourishing lives. Since such claims characterize the essential character of things, they're either necessarily true or necessarily false. In light of their incompatibility, the majority of such claims are necessarily false.

3. Many have lived flourishing lives motivationally centered around views incompatible with the existence of the monotheistic maximally great being. This in turn restores symmetry.

4. It's not clear that belief in a maximally great being is at the motivational center of flourishing lives. More plausibly, belief in an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent creator is at their motivational centers, irrespective of whether such a being exists in all possible worlds.

5. One might argue that having true motivationally central beliefs is a precondition for human flourishing. Then settling whether theistic belief is motivationally central to flourishing lives depends on settling whether theistic belief is true, and hence we can't non-question-beggingly wield the former in support of the latter.

## Godelian
The most basic and standard [[Kurt Godel’s Ontologischer Beweis|Godelian]] symmetry breaker runs as follows:
1. First, define a positive property as a property that in no way detracts from a being's greatness, and a negative property as a property that in some way detracts from a being's greatness.

2. Second, define metaphysical entailment between properties:
	- A property F metaphysically entails a property G just in case necessarily, anything that has  also has G. Equivalently, it's impossible to have F while lacking G.

3. Third, mount the following argument:
	1.  The property of being God is a positive property. (Positivity premise)
	2. No positive property metaphysically entails a negative property. (Non-entailment premise)
	3. So, the property being God does not entail a negative property (From 1, 2)
	4. If it's impossible for something to have the property being God, then the property being God does entail a negative property. (If a property is impossible to have it metaphysically entails any arbitrary property, including negative properties.)
	5. So, it's possible for something to have the property of God (from 3, 4)
	6. If it's possible for something to have the property of being God, then it's possible that God exists.
	7. So, it's possible that God exists. (From 5, 6) 

One of the main criticisms of this argument centers on the notion of positive properties. The definition of positive properties as those that don't detract from the greatness of their possessor (or those that contribute to the greatness of their possessor) is ambiguous between two readings.

1. Positive* properties are properties that, setting aside what they metaphysically entail by explosion, do not detract from the greatness (or else add to the greatness) of their possessor
2. Positive' properties are properties that, taking into account what they metaphysically entail by explosion, do not detract from the greatness (or else add to the greatness) of their possessor.

The previous definition of positive property is ambiguous between positive* property and positive' property. The dilemma is that positive properties are either to be understood as positive* properties of positive' properties. Either way, the argument does not succeed.

1. Suppose we understood positive properties as positive* properties.
	1. Then premise (1) strikes me as clearly true. It's very plausible to me that being God are positive* properties. Even though we suspend judgment about whether these properties are even possibly instantiated.
	2. It seems that premise (2) is entirely unmotivated. It's not plausible that <no positive* properties metaphysically entail negative* properties>. For a property F to not metaphysically entail anther property G is just for it to be metaphysically possible for something to have F without having G. And it's not intuitive or plausible that every positive* property is metaphysically possibly had without its possessor having a bad-making property, simply because it's not intuitive that every positive* property is metaphysically possibly had. For example, being God, being perfect, and being omnipotent are positive*, but its not intuitive to me that God, perfection, omniscience, etc. are metaphysically possible. Indeed, it seems that one would only be in a position to accept this non-entailment premise if one already granted God's metaphysical possibility.
2. Suppose we understood positive properties as positive' properties.
	1. Then it's not intuitive that being God, being perfect, being omnipotent, and the like are positive' properties. These are great making features ignoring their metaphysical entailments by explosion. But since their metaphysical possibility is required in order to be positive' properties, one may find themselves bereft of the intuition that they're positive' properties when taking account of their metaphysical entailments by explosion. 
	2. The metaphysical possibility of these properties are required in order to be positive properties for the following reason: Suppose a property is metaphysically impossible. Then that property metaphysically entails by explosion being vicious, racist, vile, bad-making, etc. So if a property is metaphysically impossible, then it isn't a positive property. Hence's a property's metaphysical possibility is needed for it to be a positive' property.
3. Either way, one premise isn't plausible and is dialectically inappropriate.

There is no bullet-biting, we can preserve the intuition that being God is positive by holding that they are indeed positive*. And I don't see the cost in denying that God is positive'.

To summarize, the property mentioned in (1), say the property of being God, doesn't seem positive simplicitier. It's positive in one sense, namely, a sense which prescinds from metaphysical entailment by explosion, but it doesn't seem positive in another sense, namely, a sense which doesn't prescind.

In the first sense, the second premise turns out unmotivated, and in the second sense, the first premise turns out unmotivated. So there's no sense of positivity in which the argument give's reason to sway towards theism.

## Maximal God
*The symmetry breaker.* On the maximal God thesis, God is understood as the being with the best possible combination of knowledge, power, and goodness.. The maximal God approach to perfect being theism construes God as the greatest metaphysically possible being. Then the possibility of God's existence is simply secured by definition.

*Objections.*
1. Many objections have been leveled to the maximal God approach to perfect being theism. There are worries about what could explain God's precise, coordinated combination of degrees of great-making properties, worries about whether there is a uniquely best possible combination of great-making properties, worries about whether there is even a *best* possible combination of great-making properties that don't reach their intrinsic maxima, worries about implying polytheism, and so on.

2. The maximal God thesis does not accord with a common understanding of God as a perfect being. Consider: under some versions of naturalism, the greatest possible being will be a complex highly intelligent, but severely limited embodied conscious organism. The maximal god thesis implies that such a being would be God. This is implausible and runs contrary to what proponents of perfect being theology typically say about God. The general problem is that there's no guarantee that the greatest possible combination of knowledge, power, and goodness will be anything deserving the appellation 'God.'

3. There's no guarantee that the best possible combination of knowledge, power, and goodness can be instantiated *together with necessary existence*. Perhaps there cannot be necessarily existent concreta. Or perhaps all necessary concrete are axiologically surpassable in their combination of knowledge, power, and goodness. (E.g. perhaps the necessary concreta are one or more fundamental physical particles or fields. The combination of knowledge, power, and goodness enjoyed by such necessary concrete is clearly axiologically inferior to that of various contingent persons.) If any such proposal is correct, the best possible combination of knowledge, power, and goodness cannot belong to a necessarily existent thing. In which case the necessity premise of the MOA is undercut.

## Modal Continuity
*The symmetry breaker.* Some degree of value is possibly instantiated. But if *some* degree of value is possibly instantiated, then *each* degree of value is possibly instantiated. This falls out of a broader *modal continuity* principle which states that properties differing merely in degree tend to be modally uniform. Either all are possible or all are impossible. So each degree of value is possibly instantiated. But *maximal greatness* is a degree of value. So maximal greatness is possibly instantiated. Assuming that the characterized being in the MOA's possibility premise is a maximally great being, the truth of that premise follows.

*Objections.*
1. The modal continuity principle is at least controversial, and those inclined to mitigated modal skepticism will reject it when applied to cases far from our everyday experience (e.g., infinite, unsurpassable degrees of value).

2. Some degree of value is possibly not instantiated. But if some degree of value is possibly not instantiated, then each degree of value is possible not instantiated. Since maximal greatness is a degree of value, maximal greatness is possibly not instantiated, and symmetry is restored.

3. Since some degree of value is possibly instantiated, each degree of value is possibly instantiated. But the instantiation of some degrees of value precludes the instantiation of maximal greatness. An example of a maximal-greatness precluding degree of value is *near maximality*, where x is near maximal just in case x enjoys every perfection essentially except for being nearly omnipotent, x can do everything an omnipotent being can do except for performing some trivial task. If maximal greatness is a degree of value, near maximality is likewise a degree of value. Since being the intensional source of every other concrete thing is plausibly a perfection, and since a maximally great being would be independent, the possible instantiation of near maximality implies the possible non-instantiation of maximal greatness. Since the former is possibly instantiated (1*) follows. This parallel argument shows the modal continuity principle to be false.

4. Since some degree of disvalue is possibly instantiated, each degree of disvalue is possibly instantiated. But then infinite disvalue is possibly instantiated. Infinitely many increasingly worse orders of infinite disvalue are possibly instantiated. Plausibly, God would not allow something with infinite disvalue to exist. Hence, the possible instantiation of infinite disvalue implies the possible non-instantiation of maximal greatness. From this (1*) follows.

5. The modal continuity principle is especially questionable in cases of infinite quantities. Huemer has argued from a suite of infinity paradoxes that all infinite intensive magnitudes are impossible. There is ferocious debate on the possibility of various infinite quantities. Since maximal greatness is an infinite quantity of value, it's not entirely clear we can reliably use the modal continuity principle to infer its possible instantiation.

6. Perhaps maximal greatness is more plausibly understood as a qualitatively complete and unlimited kind of value rather than an infinite quantity of value. A longstanding theistic tradition holds that God's greatness differs from ours not in quantity but in quality or kind.

7.  Consider that some degree of valuable island is possibly instantiated. But if some degree of valuable island is possibly instantiated, then each degree of valuable island, including a maximally great island, is possibly instantiated. A maximally great island would necessarily exist if it exists at all. Then a maximally great island is possibly necessary and hence necessary by S5.
	1. Echoing Plantinga, we have independent reason to think there cannot be a maximally great island, since the great making features of islands do not admit of intrinsic maxima.
		1. The great-making features for beings may not admit of intrinsic maxima either. A being may be better if it actualizes a better world, and the value of worlds may admit of no maximum.
		2. Even if the greatest making properties of islands do not admit of intrinsic maxima, the impossibility of a maximally great island does not follow. For there may be some precise trade-off among the various great island-making features that is uniquely best. 
		3. Parodies can be run with entities whose great-making features who do admit of intrinsic maxima. Consider a Solo-Know, a necessary being who by nature has one ability: to know the truth values of propositions. The greatness of Solo-Know is solely a function of its modal status and the extent of its knowledge, both of which admit of intrinsic maxima by the lights of those who mount the above reply.
	2. Necessary existence does not contribute to the greatness of an island qua island; it only contributes to the greatness of something qua being. Then being a maximally great island doesn't entail necessary existence.
		1. One might think that a necessary island intuitively is a better island qua island than contingent one. (For instance, perhaps an island is better qua island the less susceptible it is to submersion. A necessary island is not even possibly submerged, and hence it is maximally insusceptible to submersion.)
		2. Even if a necessary island isn't better than a contingent island qua island, one might still think that the former is *better* than the latter. So long as a necessary island is *better* than a contingent one, a maximally great island, i.e. an island whose greatness is unsurpassable by any other island, would enjoy necessary existence. Otherwise, a maximally great island would be surpassible in greatness by a qualitatively identical island enjoying necessary existence, which is absurd.
