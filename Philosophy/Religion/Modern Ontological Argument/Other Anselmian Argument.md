[[Norman Malcolm & Charles Hartshorne's Argument|PERFnecEx&necPerf]] says how Hartshorne may have gotten ***AP*** as the former entails ***AP***. For this entailment we may reason that, if something exemplifies perfection, then there is a thing that is necessarily existent and perfect, from which it follows 
that in every world something is perfect.

Given that it entails ***AP***, this principle can replace it for the following Anselmian argument: $$\begin{align}\text{IP}&: && \Diamond\exists xPx\\
\text{PERFnecEx\&necPerf}&: &&\Box\forall x[Px \to \Box(\exists!x \land Px)]\\
&& &\therefore \exists xPx\end{align}$$
Harthorne's premises ***AP*** and ***IP*** do not involve quantification into modal contexts. This allows his deduction to go forward in a [[Necessity and Possibility|sentential modal logic]]. However, PERFnecEx&necPerf involves quantification into a modal context, and the deduction from it and ***IP*** must proceed in a quantified modal logic. Similarly for the next argument.

For this argument we'll replace ***AP*** with a weaker premise, and ***IP*** with a stronger premise. The replacement for ***AP*** stipulates that perfection is an existence-entailing predicate. This replacement says that only existents can be perfect. $$\begin{align}\textbf{\emph{PrfExEntlng} :} && \Box\forall x\Box (Px \to \exists!x) \end{align}$$
"But are not all predicates 'existence-entailing", don't all predicates suppose the existence of their subjects? No, Certainly 'does not exist' as in  'Santa Claus does not exist' is not existence-entailing.

Another kind of *example* is, 'is popular the world over', as in 'Santa Claus is popular the world over', is not existence-entailing.

Predicates that are not existence-entailing may be labeled 'intensional predicates'; 'is loved' and 'is popular' are examples of these.

From ***PrfExEntlng*** it follows that $$\exists x \Box Px \to \Box\exists xPx$$
as well as $$\Box[\exists x \Box Px \to \Box\exists x Px]$$
The strengthened version of ***IP***, $$\begin{align}\textbf{\emph{StrgIP} :} && \Diamond
\exists x \Box Px\end{align}$$
It from ***PrfExEntlng*** and ***StrgIP*** that $\Box \exists x Px$. ***StrgIP*** says that necessary perfection is possible in the sense that in some world there is a being that is necessarily perfect. 

In Hartshorne's arrangement, while ***IP*** can seem innocuous, ***AP*** depends on strong Anselmian stipulations concerning perfection. In this arrangement, ***StrgIP*** is somewhat demanding, while ***PrfExEntlng*** seems innocuous.

## 'It's the Possibility!'
The burden of Anselmian arguments falls on their possibility=premises. Their other premises are consequences of stipulations concerning what are perfections, and so are not proper objects of resistance, even if they cannot be, as it seems they can be, provided with theological and metaphysical motivation.

In contrast, Hartshorne's ***IP*** and its strengthening, ***StrgIP***, are not stipulations. These possibility-premises, given in-force stipulations concerning the sense of perfection, make difficult substantive claims. Much of *Proslogion* II is an *argument* for a perfect being's existing at least 'in the mind'. 

Should these possibility=premises be given the benefit of the doubt on the general ground that things should be judged possible until they are proved impossible? Leibniz thought so

This principle is unacceptable however. As van Inwagen points out, it would in many cases entail inconsistent 'presumptions'. For an example close to hand, it may be that we cannot prove that Hartshorne's perfect beings are impossible and that we cannot prove that a being who knows there is no such perfect being is impossible. Suppose then a principle that would have us presume that whatever we cannot prove to be impossible is possible, would have us presume possible and necessary that there is a Hartshorne perfect being, and presume also that a 'knowno'' is possible so that it is **not** necessary that there is a Hartshorne perfect being,
## Foes of Ontological Arguments say that their Possibility-Premises beg questions

Foes of the ontological arguments may say that ***IP***, the possibility of a perfect being, given that being perfect entails existing in and being perfect in every world, says *more* than the argument's extended conclusion, which is merely that it is necessary that there exists a perfect being.

Why more? Because there can exist a perfect being in every world even if each world has a different perfect being. Under italicized stipulations relevant to them, ***IP*** and ***StrgIP*** entail that it's necessary that there exists a being that exists and is perfect in every world.

The trouble is not that 'perfection' variously understood is not possible, though depending on its exact terms it may not be possible. The trouble, given how 'perfection' is elaborated in valid Hartshorne-Plangtina MOA's is that these arguments use possibility=premises that are equivalent to their conclusions. Some use possibility-premises that are stronger than their conclusions.

To find examples of  both troubles in Harthorne's original argument from ***AP*** and ***IP***, observe that:
1. ***AP*** is to be analytic of the Anselmian concept of perfection, and as such is not to make a substantive contentious claim
2. That this analytic articulation of the meaning of perfection entails the equivalence: $$[\textbf{\emph{IP}}: \Diamond\exists x Px] \equiv \Box\exists xPx$$
Taking certain possibilities as premises of these arguments, given stipulations made in them concerning the nature of perfection, ***begs the question***, critics say, that these arguments pretend to address.

These MOA's have this in common with some classical non-modal ontological arguments. The difference is that those non-modal ontological arguments beg questions under over of ambiguities and amphibolies, whereas these modal arguments proceed validly under covers of complicated, concealing fogs of complexity.

## Friends of Ontological Arguments Respond
### *Some say question-begging is not a viable charge against these arguments.*
An advocate may say that these arguments are valid, that they have logically necessary premises since these affirm logical necessities and possibilities, and that they thus have logically necessary conclusions that, since logically necessary, are equivalent to their premise.

This is a feature of every *demonstration*, including mathematical demonstrations that no one would say are guilty of question begging. 

### *Some may add that if this is question-begging, it is good question-begging.*
Even though the possibility-premises of our arguments do, given stipulations concerning perfections, entail by themselves necessary existence conclusions, they enjoy, over these conclusions, a heuristic advantage. By making the immediate issue not the truth of a necessity, $\Box \exists x Px$, but instead of the truth of the related possibility, $\Diamond \exists x Px$, the argument makes evident the applicability of *a priori* methods.

Possibilities can sometimes be found out by thinking about concepts and 'seeing' that one is working with an idea that does not harbor a contradiction and is of an understandable, conceivable kind of thing. Such views of the epistemological advantages of possibilities are common to most advocates of the ontological argument.

Plantinga sometimes equates the coherence of an idea with the possibility of its objects. 

The possibility-premises of MOA's afford plain access of a kind not plainly afforded by their existence and necessary existence conclusions. This makes wrong-headed the castigation of these premises as question-begging. They show us advantaged ways to the conclusion that they anticipate.

"Tis an establish'd maxim in metaphysics" that **possibilities can be proved *a priori*, that whatever is *conceivable* is *possible*** - Hume

## But that Conceivability Entails Possibility is not true.
It can seem that possibilities are easier to reach than necessities because there is *a priori* access to possibilities. But it is not so. For there *are* no *a priori* possibilities. It's a mistake to think that *a priori* self consistency, which is to say 'freedom from *a priori* discoverable contradiction is sufficient for the possibilities affirmed in the premises of MOAs. This is *the* mistake of Anselmian arguments.

Rowe uses the idea of a **magician**, an existing magician, and has us suppose that no magicians has ever existed.

Regarding a *magician* or 'existing magician', understand that something is a *magician* in a possible world if and only if it is a *magician* in the *actual world*.

In this account or definition both '*magician*' and 'magician' are existence-entailing predicates. The account, for greater explicitness, is thus that something x is a *magician* 'at' a possible world w if and only if:
1. x exists in w
2. x exists and is a magician in the actual world

The predicate 'is a *magician* in one way goes beyond the predicate 'is a magician: Being a *magician* in a world entails existing not only in that world, but also in the actual world, if that world is not itself the actual world.

In another way, the predicate 'is a magician' goes beyond 'is a *magician*: Being a *magician* 'at' a world w does not entail being a magician in w.

The phrase 'the actual world' is potentially ambiguous. Considering uses of this phrase by you and me, 'the actual world' can serve either as a 'rigid designator' at every possible world for this world of ours in which we leave and breathe or as a 'nonrigid designator' that, at a possible world, designates that world.

Here we're using 'the actual world' following Lewis who uses '@' and Plantinga who sometimes uses 'Kronos' as proper names of this world of ours.

If we used 'the actual world' as a non-rigid designator '*magician*' would have been a synonym of 'magician'.

Answers to two questions about *magicians* make the point that '*a priori* self-consistency' does not entail possibility. 

1. Is the idea of a *magician* '***a priori self-consistent***'? or free of *a priori* inconsistency? Answer: Yes. No contradiction follows simply by virtue of ideas or meanings of words from the assumption that there is a *magician*. After all, there *is* a *magician* if and only if there is a magician, and 'there is a magician'  is not *a priori* inconsistent. It is not knowable *a priori* that there are no magicians.
2. Is it ***possible*** that there is a *magician*, is this ***logically possible***? Answer: No, given the supposition under which we are operating that "no magician have ever existed". Though there is not contradiction in the idea of a magician, in asserting that a magician is possible we are directly implying that some existing thing is a magician. So if as supposed "no existing thing is a magician", there is in no possible world a *magician*. Put otherwise, it is *possible* that there is a *magician* if and only if there *is* a magician. So, given that there is not a magician, it is not possible that there is a *magician*.

### *'Unicrons' and 'dragoons' to the same point.*
Rowe needed to *assume* that there have been no magicians. To proceed without assumption he might have used ***unicrons***, defined as things that exist in @ and are unicorns in @, for it is a give in current philosophical discourse that no unicorn has ever existed. Similarly for dragons. 

Let 'D' say that *there are Dragons*, let '*D*' say *there are Dragoons*, and let something be a *dragoon* at a possible world if and only if
1. it exists in that possible world
2. it exists in and is a dragon in @

Then, it is possible that there is a *dragoon* if and only if there is actually a dragon: $\Diamond \exists x Dx \equiv  \exists x \text{D} x$

That follows from the definition of '*dragoon*' and so is necessary *a priori*. 

Since there is not actually a dragon, it is therefore not possible that there is a *dragoon*, and therefore Dragoons are not *possible*, though they are imaginable and though there is no *a priori* contradiction in our concept of them.

### *Consistency, a priori, and logical.*
Rowe's idea of a *magician* is *a priori* self-consistent. No contradiction follows merely by virtue of meanings of worlds from the proposition $M$ that there is a magician. It does not matter to this *a priori consistency* whether there are in fact magicians, M. However, if there are no magicians, $\neg \text{M}$, then $M$ is not *logically* consistent. For if there are no magicians, then it is *necessary* that there is not a *magician*, $\Box \neg M$; so that, int his case, $M$ entails both itself, $M$, and it's negation $\neg M$ (every proposition entails every proposition that is necessary). Entailing this contradiction makes $M$ logically inconsistent, and in other words, logically impossible.

Some may argue that instead of proving logical possibility, conceivably simply counts as evidence. To grant this however, consider that we have the proposition that there is a *dragoon* is possible if and only there is a dragon is true, for short, $[\Diamond D \equiv \text{D}]$. This is *a priori* necessary. So something provides us with evidence that $\Diamond D$ is true if and only if it provides us with evidence for the truth of proposition $\text{D}$, that there are dragons. Since it's not evidence for the existence of Dragons, it isn't for the existence of Dragoons.

Similarly, one supposes, for the possibility of an unsurpassably great or perfect being, if this possibility is, by stipulations regarding greatness and perfection, made to entail the actual existence of a great or perfect being. The coherence of the concept of such a being presumably can be so decided, but not its possibility. The possibility of such a being is it seems precisely a case of a possibility for which a priori consistency and Yablo-conceiving (supposing that makes sense here) can afford no evidence.

## Demotion of the Argument from a Proof to a License to Believe.
Plantinga is an unusual exponent of an ontological argument. He says that in the best form he has discovered for it, it is without a doubt 'question-begging' and thus not proof of its theistic conclusion for anyone who needs a proof to believe. He implies there is no getting around that.

But then he says the argument is not without merit. 

> “It is evident . . . that there is nothing contrary to reason or irrational in accepting this premise. What I claim for this argument, therefore, is that it establishes, not the truth of theism, but its rational acceptability” (Plantinga 1974a, p. 112).

It is surprising that Plantinga should say there that it is evident that there is nothing contrary to reason or irrational in accepting that the existence of a maximally great being is possible, given that he has said that it “isn’t very clear,” that is, that it is not evident, that “the idea of a greatest possible being” is consistent (Plantinga 1974a, p. 91).

The problem he considers is one of the existence of maxima for the various dimensions in which a maximally excellent being would excel. He reports (all on this one page) that there are no problems with the ideas of maximal power, knowledge, and moral excellence, but that it “isn’t very clear” whether there are relevant maxima to love. Bracketing this issue, Plantinga represents himself as confident that the idea of a maximally great being is consistent. And from this confidence he moves quickly to the confidence that accepting the possibility of a maximally great Modern Modal Ontological Arguments 97 being is not contrary to reason, and from that to its not being contrary to reason to accept the necessary existence of a maximally great being, and the truth of theism, and all of this merely from the consistency of that idea.

The consistency of the idea of a *magican* does not entail the possibility of *magicans*, since this possibility would entail the reality of magicians.

Presumably the same holds of the consistency of the idea of a maximally great being and that, since the possibility of a maximally great being would entail the reality of a maximally excellent being (a being that is omnipotent and the rest), the consistency of the idea of a maximally great being would not entail the possibility of one. That consistency would be of no relevance to this possibility.

Since this possibility of a necessarily existent, essentially perfect being would entail the reality of such a being in this world of ours, there are facts that to most of the world seem to argue against it. There is the misery, there is the evil and suffering without apparent reason that would justify it to a perfect being of this world of ours. There is evidence against the possibility of a maximally great being – an omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good being, according to Plantinga – if it is allowed that facts of rampant evil and suffering are evidence against the reality of such a being.

Plantinga's MOA does not neutralize this evidence: It does not somehow dissolve its potency as a skeptical assault might pretend to do. It does not counter this evidence with other evidence, say of design or of ‘miracles,’ which would ‘overweigh’ it. It is thus far from establishing the rational acceptability of the possibility of a maximally perfect being.

It's so far from that as to make quite strange that Plantinga should have thought that it did have this not inconsiderable merit. Perhaps, however, he thought that it did not do that alone, but only when taken together with what he considered to be his solutions to the so-called logical and evidential problems of evil.

## Conclusion
There is *nothing* for theism in Anselm's marvelous *Proslogion* II argument or in it's Hartshorne/Plantinga modern update. There **is** something in *Proslogion* III, the idea that God would exist necessarily, but that has been something *negative* for philosophical theology.
