Descartes starts off by saying the idea of a supremely perfect being's nature or essence includes existence. He goes on to suggest an 'indirect' proof of God's existence, given the involvement of existence in the nature of this supremely perfect being. Try and think of a supremely perfect being not existing, such thinking "fights with itself" into a contradiction.

A being first and supreme has every perfection, and existence is a perfection, from which it follows that *a first and supreme being exists*. It's as simple as that.

## *On Toward God.*
Given that there is at least one perfect being, it's an easy inference to the conclusion that exactly one exists. It is implicit in the idea of supreme perfection that at most one supremely perfect being exists as it can be maintained that being unparalleled is itself a perfection, and that supremely perfect being would have this perfection as it would have every perfection.

Given the existence of exactly one perfect being, it can seem that nothing else could be proper object for total deference and unqualified reverence and worship.

## *An articulation of the argument.*
Let this be ***our Cartesian argument***. It is a demonstration of the existence of a supremely perfect being, that is, a deduction without aid of contingent premises. To be proved 'from scratch':

1. A supremely perfect being exists.

Assume that this is not the case. That is, assume:

2. A supremely perfect being *does not exist*.

Observe that the following are, to Descartes, necessary truths:

3. A supremely perfect being have every perfection.
4. Existence is a perfection.

From 3 and 4 it follows that,

5. A supremely perfect being *does* exist.

This contradictions 2. Premises 3 and 4 are not consistent with 2.

## *Two objections - 'the usual suspects'*
### *'It would open the floodgates.'*
The first objection is that similar arguments would establish the existence of things we think do not exist, know do not exist, and hope do not exist, respectively, supremely perfect islands, supremely perfect colleagues, and supremely evil beings.

Gaunilon made an objection of this kind to the first ontological argument, though such arguments raise presumptions against ontological arguments, suggesting something is wrong with them, they do not say what is wrong with them. They leave open the possibility that the cases of supreme perfection and maximal greatness are different in ways that make an argument from essence to actual.

We cannot be content with putting such arguments in bad company, we must explain what is wrong with the arguments.

Descartes distinguishes perfect bodies such as islands form perfect beings to explain why only the latter necessarily exist. 

The first problem is it's irrelevant to his *Fifth Meditation* proof. That proof doesn't require that the perfection of existence should be inseparable from other perfections of a perfect being, it requires that it only be among them.

Secondly, there's a problem of *substance*. Descartes contends that, whereas the perfection of a particular divine shape that belongs to a perfect being is separable from existence, the perfection of omnipotence, that belongs to a perfect being is not separable from existence. He says it is quite evident, but it isn't. The idea of a mythical omnipotent is *prima facie* coherent. 

Descartes does show that his argument is relevantly different from arguments that must be bad because their conclusions are false. However, even if the charge that it fails with them is correct, left would be the question of what is wrong with it, and them.

### *Existence is not a predicate.*
According to this objection, the fault lies in the premise that existence is a perfection. Perfections must be properties, things to be mentioned in full descriptions of objects that have them, and existence is not a property, but a precondition for having properties. So existence cannot be included.

Existence cannot be included in definitions of kinds because if it were, we could, simply by inducing it, define into existence all kinds of things, whereas it is plain that we cannot do that.

Since we cannot include existence into our concepts of things, and since we could if it were a property, the conclusion is that it isn't a property of things.

1.  We can never, merely by examining a concept deduce that anyone using it is referring to an actually existing thing.
2. We could only deduce this if existence were contained in the concept itself, we could never discover that God exists; we could do this only if his existence were part of the concept of deity, and indeed Anselm and Descartes talk as if it were â€“ but it cannot be part of any concept.

That existence cannot be part of any concept of a kind of thing follows from 1 and 2. Since any possible property of things can be included in concepts of them, it follows that existence is not a property, and therefore not a perfection.

However, contrary to Penelhum and othes, it is not as if making existence part of the concept of deity were tantamount to defining deities into existence. Only confusion make it appear so.

Hard-liners that want to ban existence from definitions of kinds of things say that one could, in Descartes's way, demonstrate the existence of all sorts of things if one could include existence in sundry definitions. That is not true.

## *The flaw of the argument - it is a matter of an article.*
The trouble with the Cartesian argument is not that it assumes without argument the [[Meaning, Modality, and Possible Worlds Semantics|possibility]] of a perfect being. Nor is the problem that it assumes that existence is a perfection. Its trouble is not metaphysical or theological, nor is it deep. It's trouble is logical.

Sentence 1 of our cartesian argument:

> P. ***A*** supremely perfect being exists

has the following interpretations:

1. ***Any*** supremely supremely perfect being exists. $\forall x Sx \to Ex$
2. ***At least one*** supremely perfect being exists. $\exists x Sx \land Ex$

The initial article 'A' is ambiguous between 'any'and 'at least one'.

1 does not say there is a supremely perfect being that exists, but only that, if it is a supremely perfect, then it exists. 2 on the other hand, is existential and says *precisely* that there is a supremely perfect being that exists. P is ambigous between 1 and 2.

1 is odd, given the stipulation that existence is included in the idea of supreme perfection, their predicates do not add to their subjects.

2 is also odd, it's explicitly redundant to say there exists an x such that x is supremely perfect and x exists.

Descartes of course wants God to 'exist in reality' or to 'actually exist'. This oddity can thus be removed by assuming that their generalizations range over things that exist in the mind or possibly exist. So henceforth the sentences 'every supremely perfect being exists' and 'at least one supremely perfect being exists' are short for ***for every thing that possibly exists, if it is supremely perfect, then it actually exists*** and ***there is at least one thing that possibly exists such that it is supremely perfect and it actually exists***.

1 is necessarily true by definition of a supremely perfect being. The status of 2 is at best problematic. 

## *Negative complications.*
Consider sentence 2 of our argument:

> P: A supremely perfect being *does not exist*

This can be read as:

1. Every supremely perfect being does not exist
2. At least one supremely perfect being does not exist.

Furthermore, each of these sentences is open to two readings, depending on the scope of the negation. For 1, the two readings:

11. It is not the case that any supremely perfect being exists. $\neg \forall x Sx \to Ex$
12. Every supremely perfect being does not exists. $\neg \forall x Sx \to \neg Ex$

For 2:

21. There is a supremely perfect being such that it does not exist. $\exists x Sx \land \neg Ex$
22. It is not the case that there is a supremely perfect being that exists. $\neg \exists x Sx \land Ex$

Of our four readings, 11 and 21 are equivalent, and 12 and 22 are equivalent.

So we have just two different readings for P. Of these, given the stipulation that existence is a perfection, 1 is necessarily false. 2 however, pending clear reasons to the contrary, isn't necessarily false. 

## *Deflating our Cartesian argument.*
The argument claims that the sentence P: (1) expresses an existential proposition, and (2) expresses a necessary truth. 1 is implied by the *point* of the argument, which is to demonstrate the existence of a supremely perfect being. 2 is implied by the arguments pretense to be a *demonstration* that proceeds without aid of contingent premises.

We have seen that P, when interpreted in one way, expresses an existential, and that when interpreted in another way, expresses a proposition that given premises that we may accept to be necessary truths is a necessary truth.

We haven't seen that P expresses a proposition that is *both* existential and necessarily true.

Let's go through the putative demonstration again.

1. At least one supremely perfect being exists. $\exists x Sx \land Ex$

Assume for proof by contradiction the negation is true.

2. No supremely perfect being exists. $\neg \exists x Sx \land Ex$

The following premises are available for a demonstration, as they are necessary truths.

3. Every supremely perfect being has every perfection.
4. Existence is a perfection

From 3 and 4 it follows that

5. Every supremely perfect being exists. $\forall x Sx \to Ex$

or equivalently

5. No supremely perfect being fails to exist. $\neg \exists x Sx \land \neg Ex$

Here, the proof stops. Since 5 doesn't contradict 2. They are both true if there is not a supremely perfect being. The ambiguous natural language makes it look contradictory. The argument does not work. Indeed, no argument *can* work for it, since, assuming the correctness of the following symbolizations, the argument isn't even valid.

3. Every supremely perfect being has every perfection. $\forall x [Sx \to \forall y[Py \to H(x, y)]]$
4. Existence is a perfection. $P(E)$
5. At least one supremely perfect being exists. $\exists x [Sx \land H(x, E)]$

This argument isn't [[Predicate Logic|valid]]. On the other hand, the Cartesian argument works when interpreted to demonstrate that universal that $\forall x [Sx \to H(x, E)]$. This is a small comfort for the philosopher who aspires to a demonstration of the existence of a supremely perfect being.

## *Our minds are Open*
We are ready to entertain reasons for thinking that

2. At least one supremely perfect being exists

like

1. Any supremely perfect being exists

is necessarily true, though no reasons are in view.
