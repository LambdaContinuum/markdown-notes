## *Spinoza's Ontological Argument.*

Proposition 11 of Spinoza's Ethics. *God or substance consisting of infinite attributes, each of which expresses an infinite essence, [[Meaning, Modality, and Possible Worlds Semantics|necessarily]] exists.*

Proof. If you deny this, conceive, if you can, that God does not exist. Therefore (Ax.7) his essence does not involve existence. But this is absurd (Pr.7). Therefore God necessarily exists.
\
\[Axiom\] 7. *If a thing can be conceived as not existing, its essence does not involve existence.*

Proposition 7. *Existence belongs to the nature of substance.*

Also important to the argument is

Definition 6. By God I mean an absolutely infinite being; that is, substance consisting of infinite attributes, each of which expresses eternal and infinite essence.

Spinoza's primary demonstration of proposition 11 is similar in several ways to arguments of Anselm and [[Rene Descartes's Ontological Proof|Descartes]]. Like theirs it purports to deduce the existence of God from what would be God's nature, and it purports to be a demonstration. These are reasons enough to say that it is an ontological argument. It is in the sense of the one who coined the label anyways, Kant:

> There are only three possible ways of proving the existence of God by means of speculative reason. All the paths leading to this goal begin either . . . ; or . . . ; or finally they abstract from all experience, and argue completely a priori, from mere concepts, to the existence of a supreme cause . . . , the third \[proof is] the ontological” (CrPR A590/B618–A591/B619, pp. 500–1).

## *What was Spinoza's argument?*
The words 'or substance consisting of infinite attributes’ present a problem.

### *On 'substantia' in Spinoza's Ethics.*
'Substantia' is for Spinoza a count-noun for independent beings. Spinoza himself says so: "By substance I mean that which is in itself and is conceived through itself; that is, that the conception of which does not require the conception of another thing from which it has to be formed"

A consequence is that, when translating the *Ethics* into English, occurrences of 'substance' want to be preceded by occurrences of articles, by 'a' or 'the', etc.

It is therefore remarkable that occurrences of 'substance' are rarely if ever embellished in these ways in Shirley's translation.

## *Spinoza's reasoning*
God would be the infinite substance. If you require proof that God necessarily exists, suppose that the infinite substance can be conceived not to exist. That, given Axiom 7 and Proposition 7, leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we have that the infinite substance cannot be conceived not to exist, which is to say that is necessarily exists. Then, by definition, *God* necessarily exists.

Two Premises:
1. *If a thing can be conceived not to exist, its essence \[or nature\]  does not involve existence.* (Axiom 7)
	- This is dubious. Might not our conception of a thing leave out things essential to it? The 'real essence' of water, some say, is H2O, even when no one's conception of water included anything like that. Why should existence be different?
2. *Existence belongs to the nature \[or essence\] of \[a\] substance.* (Proposition 7)
	- Hume lends this premise support. He claimed that "whatever we conceive, we conceive to be existent". Proposition 7 implies that we cannot so much as *conceieve* of a *substance* without existence.

First Inference:
3. *The infinite substance **cannot** be conceived not to exist.*
	- Assume, for purposes of indirect subsidiary demonstration of 3 from 1 and 2 that, to the contrary, the infinite substance can be conceived not to exist. Then, from 1, the essence or nature of the infinite substance does not involve existence. But, since the infinite substance is a substance, from 2 it follows that the essence or nature of the infinite substance does not involve existence. Contradiction.

Two more Premises:
4. *If an infinite substance exists, then God is the infinite substance.*
5. *What cannot be conceived not to exist, exists necessarily.*
	- The connection this premise makes between conceivability and necessity is plainly implicit in the compact text of Spinoza's proof, but it isn't explicitly mentioned.

Second Inference:
6. *God, the infinite substance, necessarily exists.*
	- This follows from 3, 4, and 5.
