Ontological arguments are demonstrations of God's existence, deductions from scratch without the aid of contingent premises.

Can't these existence proofs be rejected on the general ground that it's not possible to demonstrate the existence of anything?

> Cleanthes: There is an evident absurdity in pretending to demonstrate a matter of fact, or to prove it by any arguments a [[Kinds of Truths|priori]]. Nothing is demonstrable unless the contrary implies a contradiction. Whatever we conceive as existent, we can also conceive as non-existent. There is no being, therefore, whose non-existence implies a contradiction. Consequently there is no being whose existence is demonstrable. I propose this as entirely decisive. (Hume 1991, Part 10, p. 149)

While nothing is demonstrable from non-contingent premises that is not itself necessary, it does not follow from that there is nothing whose existence is demonstrable, for there are things that exist necessarily. For example, it is necessary there exists a prime number greater than 20 and less than 25, and it's 23.

## *Aspecial privilege.*
Ontological argues will say God is like a number in his existence, which is necessary much as is the existence of numbers. 

Ontological proofs attempt to show that God's existence is demonstrable. Sometimes they would explain how the supposition that there is no god, suitably spelled out, implies a contradiction.

## *Classical proofs.*
Here we'll take up classical proofs, starting with Descartes in the Fifth Meditation, going to Spinoza's, and going back to St. Anselm's argument. The implicit [[Basic overview of logic|logic]] of these arguments is [[Predicate Logic|non-modal quantified]].
