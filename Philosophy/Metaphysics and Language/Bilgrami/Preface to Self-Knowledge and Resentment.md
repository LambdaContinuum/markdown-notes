- This book argues the notion of intentionality and agency are thoroughly normative notions, and that it is these notions so understood that ground our intuition that self-knowledge has a special authority and transparency that no other knowledge possesses.
- Without these notions it is doubtful that self-knowledge can be said to be uniquely and radically set apart from other forms of knowledge, such as perceptual and inferential knowledge of the world and others.
- Knowledge of our or minds despite being "knowledge" is not merely an epistemic notion. It falls out of the exercise of the most quotidian of our capacities: to act accountably in the world.

- This claim integrates four themes that may appear to be unrelated.
1. Agency and the first person point of view.
2. The irreducible nature of value
3. The irreducible nature of intentionality
4. The special character of self-knowledge.
- If one is a certain prevalent form of naturalism these themes are presented as mysteries to be solved or removed.
- Even if you don't agree with the account of self-knowledge the arguments in the book give, you should come away with the idea that that it's not an isolated disagreement, but a broadly ideological one.

- The argument via these integrations take roughly the following path:
- [[What Makes Self-Knowledge special?|Chapter 1]] lays out what our intuitions about the special nature of self-knowledge amount to.
	- It's argued that they amount to a conviction that two properties, transparency and authority, hold only of our knowledge of our own mental states and that the focus of this book is only on intentional states such as beliefs and desires.
	- The chapter conveys the force of these intuitions by contrasting them with more standard epistemic accounts (perceptual and inferential) of self-knowledge that deny the intuitions and also by distancing the intuition from their original doctrinal Cartesian setting.
	- The chapter concludes by presenting two conditionals that respectively capture these two properties in tentative form. The pledge is to give the conceptual grounds for these two conditionals over the next four chapters and in doing so present a conclusive formulation. This would spell out the special character of self-knowledge.
- Chapters 2 and 3 provide the conceptual basis for transparency in an argument that owes to a normative conception of freedom or agency.
	- Chapter 2 spells out that conception in some initial detail and argues for it along lines that owe to Strawson's view on the subject with important modification.
	- What is initially presented is sufficient provide the basis for an argument presented in Chapter 3, that the conditional that captures transparency is true and can be asserted without any tentativeness if it is properly situation in considerations of such an integration of agency with value.
	- There is an extensive demonstration at the end of the chapter of how transparency stands in stark contrast to other causal and perceptual accounts of self-knowledge that would deny it's special character.
- Chapters 4 and 5 provide the conceptual basis for authority. 
	- They involve a more complicated dialectic because authority is harder to ground in philosophical argumentation than transparency.
	- Chapter 4 argues for the conclusion that agency, *normatively* understood along lines established in Chapter 2, is a necessary condition for thought or intentionality, minimally at some level of sophistication in which it can be self-known.
	- It does this by trying to imagine the thoughts of a figure of abject and comprehensive passivity, a subject who altogether lacks the first person point of view of agency.
	- Chapter 5 argues that if it's true that a subject without agency cannot have thoughts and intentionality, then a subject with such thoughts and intentionality must have states that are themselves normative states. Intentional states are thereby integrated (literally identified) with value, by an argument that appeals to G.E. Moore and Frege. The argument also shows that other philosophers such as Davidson do not get fully right the normative nature of intentionality.
	- The normative notion presented in chapter 2 is then more fully developed in chapter 5 by showing that to have such agency is to possess normative states of this kind that make a difference to the world by 'causing' our doings, in a sense of cause that is thoroughly non-naturalistic.
	- Such a non-naturalism is shown to require and to derive from a perspectival duality that stresses a radical Spinozist contrast between the first person point of view of agency and engagement in which norms and values are in play and a third person point of view of detachment where they are not; and philosophers such as Davidson and McDowell are criticized for failing to ground non-naturalism in this perspectival duality and as a result fail to give a satisfying account of how exactly it is that our intentional states make a difference to the world via our agency by causing out actions.
	- From all these points that integrate agency, intentionality, and value, it's concluded by further argument that subjects who possess intentional states in this specific normative sense are authoritative about them. The conditional for authority can now be asserted but only after one has seen through to its conceptual basis in such a view of the relations between agency, value, and intentionality.
- Chapter 6 recapitulates in summary the integrating strategy underlying these arguments that establish the two properties of transparency and authority, which makes for the special character of self-knowledge and it spells out some of their broadest implications for philosophy.

- To repeat: It is a large claim that our intuition that self-knowledge is in some sense unique - that it alone is authoritative and transparent - despite the manifest and ubiquitous fact of self-deception and other failures of self-knowledge, can best be retained if we situation self-knowledge in a normative setting, in particular, in normative notions of agency and mind.
