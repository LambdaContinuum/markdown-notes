Russell called mental states which possess intentionality "propositional attitudes", giving name to something that was familiar long before him: the fact, of all the states of mind there are, intentional states are unique in possessing *content*.

Content is what is specified by sentences or propositions in that-clauses when we attribute intentional states to agents. For example, in the attribution, "Smith believes that Bigmouth has struck again," the sentence or proposition which follows the "that" specifies the content.

All intentional states possess content, but for sake of convenience discussion will be restricted to beliefs. The subject here is not specifically belief how, but intentionality broadly.

There's a close and familiar connection between meaning and intentionality. The connection is not the obvious falsehood that the meaning of the sentences which an agent utters always express the contents of his beliefs. Consider utterances which are lies or metaphors. Rather, the relation is conveyed by the fact that a sincere, non-self-deceived, utterance of a sentence by agent is an utterance of something whose literal meaning gives the content of the belief that is expressed by that utterance.

The central core of Bilgrami's account of intentionality will be stated here briefly and in broad outline. Later the details will be filled in.

Bilgrami gives two principle theses about the nature of intentional content: the "unity of content" and the "locality of content". Central to these theses, is a very specific *externalist* picture of content.

A *general* characterization of the doctrine of externalism is that the contents of an agent's beliefs are not independent of the world external to the agent. Intentionality is not fully characterizable independent of the external world. In terms of external world skepticism, it denies the view that an agent's intentional contents would be just what they are even if it turned out that there was no external world.

The externalism proposed adds to this general idea a very crucial constraint. For two reasons ti may with some justification be called a Kantian reading.
1. It shows how in its representations, the mind may depend upon the world at the same time as it mediates the world upon which it depends; and it shows this without surrender to idealism with regard to the world or naturalism with regard to the mind.
2. The externalism itself is argued for on perfectly general and negative grounds. That is, like Kant's strategy against idealism (without any claims to transcendental arguments), externalism is established on the basis of perfectly general arguments which show that internalism or the scenario of Descartes's First Meditations is unacceptable.

Bilgrami's way of arguing for externalism avoids all the commitments of contemporary externalisms to direct referential links or to *de re* senses without any surrender to internalism.

Bilgrami's specific externalism alone makes it possible to maintain the thesis of the unity of content. It also requires the locality of content, for without the locality of content Bilgrami's externalism would give rise to serious problems.

So Bilgrami's externalism is necessary to have unity, but locality is necessary to Bilgrami's externalism if it is not to be rendered implausible.

# What is meant by the Unity of Content?
---
The thesis of the "unity of content" claims that there is only one notion of content, which is externally determined and which explains actions.

The point of this thesis becomes clear when one deliberates on current ways of thinking about the nature of content. The thesis of unity rejects both sides of the now orthodox distinction between "narrow" and "wide" content. It rejects the way of thinking that leads to that distinction.

The distinction is based on the claim that if content is externally determined in the way that is suggested by the well-known views on reference of Putnam, Kripke, and Burge's (i.e. if it is "wide" content), then it cannot be used in the commonsense explanation or rationalization of behavior and another notion of internal (i.e. "narrow") content is needed for such explanation.

Bilgrami's thesis states simply that contents are externally determined but it is these *same* contents which go into the commonsense psychological explanation or rationalization of behavior. There is no need for a second internal notion of content to explain behavior. It is thus a unified notion of content.

The thesis is not to be confused with a superficially similar view. The view which says wide content, i.e. content determined externally along the lines suggested by Putnam, Kripke, Burge, is sufficient to explain an action. Since wide content is a term coined by Putnam and everywhere is used to describe the view of these philosophers, it is used here in the restricted sense, not of *any* externalist content but of content which is externalist in the sense defined by their theories of reference.

Bilgrami's motivation is that externalism is necessary because if the external world does not determine the thoughts of an agent as is suggested in the scenario of Descartes's First Meditations, then it is an utter mystery how that agent's thoughts can be publicly available to another.

Externalism makes the publicness of thought and meaning possible, but this need not be the externalism which posits wide contents of Kripke and Putnam.

# Bilgrami's Externalism
---
The challenge to be met in order to attain unity against bifurcation is: how to appeal to the elements in the external environment as constituting the content of thoughts without giving up on those contents' explanatory potential in doing so?

Every known externalist position fails to meet this challenge in a satisfactory way: Kripke and Putnam's causal-essentialist view, Burge's social view, Fodor's causal-information-theoretic view.

The challenge is met by imposing an absolutely crucial constraint on the way the externalist element determines content and, as will be argued later, there is no chance that the challenge can be met without constraining the external element in this way. The constraint can be stated thus:

> (C): When fixing an externally determined concept of an agent, one must do so by looking to indexically formulated utterances of the agent which express indexical contents containing that concept and then *picking that external determinant for the concept which is in consonance with other contents that have been fixed for the agent.*

The emphasis in (C) is the constraint itself and is the heart of Bilgrami's externalism. There are other things which are not fully explicit in the brief statement which need elaboration and clarification.
1. Although the constraint and the question of externalism are formulated in the context of how we "fix" an agent's concepts and contents, this doesn't mean Bilgrami is interested only in the primarily epistemic question: how do we find out about another's concepts and contents.  That gets things the wrong way around. It's because Bilgrami takes concepts to be externally constituted that he allows himself to believe that the contents of an agents mind are necessarily public. It is because they are public items that a scrutiny of what goes into the fixing of one's concepts and contents by another is illuminating.
2. Assuming the close connection between intentionality and meaning, the word "concept" will be used merely to talk of the counterpart to "term", in the way that "content" is thought of as the counterpart to "sentence".
3. The fixing of externally determined concepts takes place by looking at the indexical contents in which they occur. Indexical contents and utterances are therefore the points of entry into another mind, since they are the first clear clues to the external sources of another's meanings. One fixes concepts first by correlating them with items in the environment of the agent who thinks and expresses them. These correlations consist in finding some sort of salient item regularly present in the environment when indexical utterances with a given term expressing some concept are uttered. 
4. One has to distinguish between those indexical utterances which are sincere and literal and those which are not. Only the former must be correlated with external saliences. There is, however, no algorithm for sifting out the sincere and literal utterances from the lies, metaphors, stage-performances, etc.  One may assume that the lies and metaphors and so on, even if more frequent, will bring no single item in the environment to the fore since they will be used with an indefinite variety of motives; so over time if there is a correlation at all with something in the environment, then we can proceed on the assumption that we had got hold of the sincere utterances and therefore have the right external determinant. This is a dynamic process of theory-building (of concept attribution or fixing) and one may revise earlier attributions if they turn out to fail to provide a coherent theoretical picture due to having fastened on some non-literal or insincere indexical utterances in the early phases
5. Not all concepts will be externally determined. For example the concept of unicorn. But these concepts will in one way or another be related to others which will be determined externally. In the case of the concept of the unicorn, it will be related by *composition* to other concepts which are externally determined: the concept of a horse, the concept of a horn, etc.;
6. What makes one an externalist at all is that in looking to fix concepts one looks to correlations with *external* things. That's externalism in the very general sense. Bilgrami's constraint on externalism gives rise to a specific account. It asserts that in selecting the item in the environment which is supposed to fix the concept that is being expressed, one has to not only pick what is salient and is correlated with that term but one has to be very careful how one *describes* this external determinant of the concept. One has to describe it in a way that fits in with other *contents* one has attributed to the agent

For the constraint, expressions such as "fits in with it" or "in consonance with" are vague. So, lets try and sharpen that intuition with an example.

Finding the right gross external item to correlate with an agent's concept requires no more than
- Shared similarity standards, presumably wired into us all so that what is grossly salient to him is not wholly at odds with what is salient to us.
- Mill's method.

These two things will only get us the relevant gross and regular saliences in the environment and no more. It's the selection of the right description of it which the constraint is meant to address, and the right description turns on looking to other beliefs attributed to the agent.

To give a crude example, suppose that by an application of Mill's methods and by shared similarity standards, we've noticed that there is a pedal regularly present under the left foot of an agent when he utters indexical utterances with a certain term. The constraint says not to describe this external determinant of his concept expressed by that term as 'clutch' if one has no confidence that he has other beliefs regarding the inner workings of an automobile. If one could not describe the determinant that way, one would not end up attributing the determined concept of a clutch to the agent and so no contents relating to clutches.

A few features of the constraint should be noticed
1. The word "cause" has not been used while talking of external things. We talk of "external determinants" rather than "external cause".
2. There's a strong element of anti-foundationalism built into this constraint. To Bilgrami anti-foundationalist holism and externalism are both essential features of content and they're compatible.

Insistence on describing the external in terms of the beliefs of the agent may give rise to two impressions, one wrong, one right.
1. It will gives the impression that Bilgrami is an internalist since the appeal to the agent's beliefs in fastening on an appropriate description of the external determinant is an appeal to an internalist filter upon the external. It's false to think of the filter as internal since the belief contents of an agent which provide the filter will contain concepts which are themselves externally determined. If internal is defined as in contrast to externally constituted content, there's nothing internal about the filter.
2. It will give the impression that since the external items that fix concepts and give meanings to terms are always mediated by other beliefs, my notion of meaning and intentionality will never be naturalistically reducible. The irreducibility of semantics and intentionality lies in the necessity of imposing my constraint at all levels. The unity of content is only possible if one believes in the irreducibility of the mental.

Note the constraint only explicitly mentions that its concepts and not contents which are externally determined. This is important as Bilgrami's view is that content itself is only derivatively determined externally. Content is external only in the sense that it is concepts of which it is composed that are externally determined.

# What is meant by the Locality of Content?
---
Bilgrami's constraint on externalism requires that no concept be attributed along externalist lines, unless it's in consonance with the other contents of the agent to whom it is being attributed.

This leads to a fine-grained notion of concepts. After all, the beliefs of an agent that are relevant to (and that she associates with) her term "clutch" might be numerous and diverse. 

It may seem alarming since no two people are ever likely to have the same concepts since they will almost certainly associate different beliefs with their respective terms. This however, doesn't matter for the following reason.

Bilgrami's use of the term "concept" to describe what is attributed in this way needs qualification. These attributions of concepts are attributions of things that do not go directly into the attribution of specific contents to explain behavior. All that they do at this stage is provide a pool of resources which one uses in a selective way in order to attribute specific contents in the explanation of behavior.

Suppose you know a fair amount of chemistry and I know none, so you have various beliefs about chemicals and I do not. The concept "water" attributed to you in accord with the constraint requires that it be different from the concept attributed to me. Your beliefs which constrain the description of the external substances with which your "water" utterances are correlated will be different from mine since you have beliefs about its chemical composition which I do not.

At the general, or as Bilgrami calls it the "meaning-theoretic" or "aggregative", level of concept attribution it's unlikely that any two people will have the same concept of anything since it's unlikely that they have the same beliefs associated with the term which expresses the concept. This is the level on which theories of meaning do their work: they specify the concepts or the term-meanings of an agent along the lines of this constrained externalist method. At the meaning-theoretic level, concepts are very fine-grained and they are hardly ever shared by people.

This doesn't matter, it's not *these* "concepts" which go into the contents that explain actions. Action-explanation takes place at a much more local level than the meaning-theoretic level. Here, the entire aggregate of beliefs that an agent associates with "water" are not all relevant. One distills out of the aggregate of resources provided by the meaning-theory only those beliefs that are relevant to the action-explanation at the local level.

Thus, if you and I are both drinking some substance from the kitchen tap because we want to quench our thirst with the cheapest available drink, we may *in this locality* both be attributed the same content "... that water will quench thirst."

In this locality of explanation, your chemical beliefs are simply not among the beliefs selected from the specifications of the meaning-theory. The specification of your local water-concept in the attribution of concepts which explains your behavior does not contain your chemical beliefs. Those beliefs are not needed in this locality so the specifications of the local water-concept ignores them.

Hence, our idiolects are never likely to the be the same for any single concept, in many localities we may nevertheless share many contents. There will be other localities in which we will not share contents because in those localities we'll find it necessary to use your chemical beliefs from the overall pool in order to explain your actions.

The locality of content is forced by the anti-foundationalist holism which is essential to the thesis of the unity of content. Without locality there would be a serious problem with how holistic anti-foundationalism threatens realism about content.

One of the chief points underlying the locality of content is that the idea of a theory of meaning is not really as important as it's been taken to be. The deliverances of a holistic meaning-theory do not have anything directly to do with contents as we attribute them in explanations of behavior. Meaning-theories provide a pool of resources and no more. Content as it enters into the explanation of behavior is always local because the questions asked and the explanations sought are always in particular contexts.

The entire idea of meaning-theory and the concepts or meanings it specifies is exhausted by its role in the following scheme:

Contents attributed in particular localities are comprised of concepts, which are themselves cashed out in terms of a selection of beliefs, and the idea of a selection of believes requires the idea of some place from which the selection is made. The idea of a meaning-theory is merely a gesture acknowledging that a selection has to be a selection from somewhere. It has no further role than one of marking that place.

Since the "unity thesis" is based on the rejection of a whole way of thinking which leads to certain basic distinctions about intentional content, and since the "locality thesis" dissolves the very idea of content composed of context-invariant concepts, this account of intentionality is genuinely radical.
