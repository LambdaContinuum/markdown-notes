The dualistic approach to mind encompasses several different theories, but they all agree that the essential nature of conscious intelligence resides in something *nonphysical*. Something forever beyond the scope of sciences like physics, neurophysiology, and computer science.

Dualism is not the most widely held view in the current philosophical and scientific community, but it is the most common theory of mind in the public at large. It's deeply entrenched in most of the world's popular religions and it's been the dominant theory of mind for most of Western history.

# Substance Dualism
---
The distinguishing claim of this view is that *each mind is a distinct nonphysical thing*. An individual 'package' of nonphysical substance, whose identity is independent of any physical body to which it may be temporarily 'attached'.

Mental states and activities derive their special character from their being states and activities of this unique, nonphysical kind of substance.

This leaves us wanting to ask for something in the way of a *positive* characterization of this proposed mind-stuff. It's a frequent complaint with the substance dualist's approach that his characterization is almost entirely negative. We are told what it *isn't*, not what it *is*.

Descartes has done as much as anyone to provide a positive account of the nature of the proposed mind-stuff. We'll examine his view.

## Cartesian Dualism
Descartes theoreized that reality divides into two basic kinds of substance.
1. Ordinary physical matter, the essential feature of this kind of substance is that its *extended in space*: any instance of it has length, breadth, and height, and occupies a determinate position in space. He dubbed it *res extensa* (extended substance).
2. A substance that has no spacial extension or spatial position whatever, a substance whose essential feature is the activity of *thinking*. He dubbed this *res cogitans* (thinking substance),

This view is known as *Cartesian Dualism*. The real you is not your material body, but rather a non-spatial thinking substance. A unit of mind-stuff distinct from your material body. This non-physical mind is in systematical causal interaction with your body. The physical state of your body's sense organs causes visual/auditory/tactile experiences in your mind. And the desires and decisions of your nonphysical mind cause your body to behave in purposeful ways. Its two-way causal connections to your mind are what make your particular body yours, and not something else's.

The reasons offered in support of this view:
1. Descartes thought he could determine, by direct introspection alone, that he was essentially a thinking substance and nothing else.
2. He could not imagine how a purely physical system could ever use language in a relevant way, or engage in mathematical reasoning, as any normal human can.

Before engaging with these reasons, let's notice a first difficulty that Descartes himself recognized.

If 'mind-stuff' is so utterly different from 'matter-stuff' in its nature, in that it occupies no position in space, then how is it possible for my mind to have any causal influence on my body at all? Descartes himself was aware (he was one of the first to formula the law of conservation of momentum in any physical system), ordinary matter in space behaves according to rigid laws, and one cannot get bodily movement from nothing.

How then is his insubstantial 'thinking-substance' to have any causal influence on ponderous matter? Descartes proposed a subtle *material* substance, which he called "animal spirits", to convey the mind's influence to the brain and to the body in general. But this isn't a solution, it leaves the same problem. How can something spatial causally interact with something entirely non-spatial, Descartes *res cogitans*.

In any case the basic principle of division used by Descartes is no longer plausible. Its neither useful nor accurate to characterize ordinary matter as that-which-has-extension-in-space. Electrons are bits of matter, but our best current theories describe the electron as a *point*-particle with no extension whatever. And according to quantum theory, it even lacks a determinate position. Moreover, according to Einstein's theory of gravity, an entire star can achieve this same status if a complete gravitational collapse reduces it to a singularity.

## Popular Dualism
Such difficulties may motivate a less radical form of substance dualism, Churchland calls this view *popular dualism*. The theory that a person is a 'ghost in a machine,' where the machine is the human body, and the ghost is a spiritual substance, quite unlike physical matter in its internal constitution, but fully possessed of spatial properties even so. Minds are held to be *inside* the bodies they control: inside the head on most views, in intimate contact with the brain.

The view doesn't have the difficulties of Descartes'. The mind is right there in spatial contact with the brain, and their causal interaction can perhaps be understood in terms of their exchanging energy of a form that our science has not yet recognized or understood. Perhaps mind-stuff is a well-behaved form or manifestation of energy,  but in a different form. It's thus *possible* that a dualism of this sort be consistent with the familiar laws concerning the conservation of momentum and energy. This is fortunate for dualism.

This view also holds out the possibility that the mind might survive the death of the body. It does not guarantee the mind's survival because it remains possible that the peculiar form of energy here supposed to constitute a mind can be produced and sustained only in conjunction with the highly intricate form of matter we call the brain, and must disintegrate when the brain disintegrates.

Positive evidence for the existence of this novel, nonmaterial thinking *substance* is in general on the slim side. This moved many to articulate less extreme forms of dualism.

# Property Dualism
---
The basic idea here is that there is no *substance* to be dealt with beyond the physical brain, the brain has a special set of *properties* possessed by no other kind of physical object. It's these special properties that are nonphysical: hence the term *property dualism*.

The properties in question are: the property of being in pain, of having a sensation of red, of thinking *P*, of desiring that *Q*, and so forth. They are held to be nonphysical in that they can never be reduced to or explained in terms of the concepts of the familiar physical sciences.

From here, important differences among several positions emerge.

## Epiphenomenalism
Perhaps the oldest version of property dualism, *epiphenomenalism* holds that mental properties are not a part of the physical phenomena in the brain that ultimately decide our physical behavior, but rather ride 'above the fray' of such physical activity.

Mental properties are thus *epiphenomena*. They are held to just appear or emerge when the growing brain passes a certain level of complexity.

The epiphenomenalist holds that while mental phenomena are caused to occur by the various activities within the brain, *they do not have any causal effect in turn*. They are entirely impotent with respect to causal effects on the physical world. They are *mere* epiphenomena.

This means that the universal conviction that one's actions are determined by one's desires, decisions, and volitions is false. Rather, one's actions are exhaustively determined by physical events within the brain, which events *also* cause the epiphenomena we call desires, decisions, and volitions. There is a constant conjunction between volitions and physical actions, but it's a mere illusion that the former cause the latter.

The view strikes Churchland as a bargain struck between the desire to respect a rigorously scientific approach to the explanation of behavior, and the desire to respect the testimony of one's own introspection.

## Interactionist Property Dualism
The epiphenomenalist's demotion of mental properties to causally impotent by-products of physical brain activity has seemed too extreme for most property dualists.

*Interactionist property dualism* differs from the previous view in only one essential respect: mental states do indeed have causal effects on the brain, and thereby, on behavior. Mental properties of the brain are an integrated part of the overall causal fray. One's actions are held to be caused by one's desires and volitions after all.

Mental properties are still said to be *emergent* properties, properties that do not appear until ordinary physical matter has managed to organize itself into a system of sufficient complexity.

Examples would be the the property of being *solid*, being *colored*, and being *alive*. All these require atomic and molecular matter to be suitably organized before they can be displayed.

Property dualists make a further claim, mental properties are *irreducible*, the are not just organizational features of physical matter. Mental states are novel properties beyond prediction or explanation by physical sciences.

The irreducibility of mental properties is what makes the position a dualist position. But it sits poorly with the joint claim that mental properties emerge from nothing more than the organization of physical matter. If that's how mental properties are produces, one would expect a physical account of them to be possible. The simultaneous claim of evolutionary emergence and irreducibility is prima facie puzzling, if not contradictory.

A property dualist could let go of the thesis of evolutionary emergence, maybe mental properties are *fundamental* properties of reality, properties that have been here since the universe's inception, properties on pat with properties such as length, mass, charge, time, and other fundamental properties.

There is historical precedent for a position of this kind. In the early 1900s, it was widely believed that electromagnetic phenomena such as electric charge, magnetic attraction, and electromagnetic waves were just an unusually subtle manifestation of purely *mechanical* phenomena. Most scientists though that an explanatory reduction of electromagnetic's to mechanics was more or less in the bag. For example they thought radio waves would turn out to be just traveling oscillations or *waves* in a very subtle jellylike aether that filled space everywhere. This aether turned out not to exist! Electromagnetic properties turned out to be fundamental properties in their own right, and we were forced to add *electric charge* to the existing list of fundamental properties.

## Elemental Property Dualism
Perhaps mental properties enjoy a status like that of electromagnetic properties: irreducible but not emergent. Such a view may be called *elemental-property dualism*.

Such a view has advantage of clarity over the previous view, but the parallel with electromagnetic phenomena has one very obvious failure. Electromagnetic properties are displayed at all levels of reality from the subatomic level on up, and form the earliest stages of the cosmos to the present. Mental properties are displayed only in large physical systems that have evolved a superlatively complex internal organization, a process that has take over ten billion years.

The factual and historical case for the evolutionary emergence of mental properties through the progressive organization of matter is extremely strong. They don't appear basic or elemental at all.

This returns us to the issue of their irreducibility. Why should we accept this most basic of the dualist's claims? Why be a dualist?

# Arguments for Dualism
---
1. *Argument from religion*. A major source of dualistic convictions is the religious belief many of us bring to these issues. Each of the world's major religions is in its way a theory about the cause or purpose of the universe, and many of them are committed to the notion of an immortal soul, a form of substance dualism. If one is consistent in one's beliefs, to consider disbelieving dualism is to consider disbelieving one's religious heritage, and some of us find that difficult to do. Call this *the argument from religion*.
2. *Argument from introspection*. A more universal consideration, the fact is, when you center your attention on the contents of your conscious, you do not comprehend a neural network pulsing with electrochemical activity: rather, you apprehend a flux of thoughts, sensations, desires, and emotions. It seems mental states and properties, as revealed in introspection, could hardly be more different from physical states and properties if they tried. The verdict of introspection, therefore, seems strongly on the side of some form of dualism.
3. *Argument from irreducibility*. A cluster of important considerations can be collected under this argument. One points to a variety of mental phenomena where it seems clear that no purely physical explanation could account for what's going on. Descartes cited our capacity to use language and our faculty of reasoning, particularly as its displayed in our capacity for mathematical reason. These abilities must be beyond the capacity of a purely physical system. More recently the introspectible qualities of our sensations (sensory 'qualia') and the meaningful contents of our thoughts and belief have been cited as phenomena that will resist explanatory reduction to the physical.
4. Parapsychological phenomena are occasionally cited in favor of dualism. Telepathy, precognition, telekinesis, and clairvoyance are all deeply awkward to explain within the normal confines of psychology and physics. If these phenomena are real, they might be reflecting the super-physical nature that the dualist ascribes to the mind.

There are serious criticisms of each.
1. There's nothing wrong in principle with appealing to a more general framework or theory that bears on the case at issue, which is what the appeal to religion amounts to. But the appeal can be only as good as the credentials of the religion being appealed to. In general attempts to decide questions by appeal to religious orthodoxy have a sorry history. History aside, one's own religious convictions are probably not the reasoned outcome of a dispassionate and unprejudiced evaluation of all of the major alternatives. If it was the case, one would expect the major faiths to be distributed more or less randomly or evenly across the globe. But in fact they show an overwhelmingly strong tendency to cluster. This illustrates what we all suspected anyway: *social forces* are the primary determinants of religious belief for people in general.
2. The argument from introspection assumes our faculty of inner observation or introspection reveals things as they really are in their innermost nature. This assumption is suspect because we already know that our other forms of observation - sight, hearing, touch, and so on - do no such thing. The red surface of an apple does not *look* like a matrix of molecules reflecting photons at predominantly long wavelengths, but that is what it is. The sound of a flute does not *sound* like a sinusoidal compression wave train in the atmosphere, but that is what it is. The warmth of the summer air does not *feel* like the mean kinetic energy of millions of tiny molecules, but that is what it is. If one's pain and hopes and beliefs do not *introspectively seem* like the electrochemical states of a neural network (one's brain), that may be only because our faculty of introspection is not sufficiently penetrating to reveal such hidden details. Which is just what one would expect anyway. Unless we can argue that the faculty of introspection is quite different from all other forms of observation, the argument from introspection is without force.
3. The argument from irreducibility presents a more serious challenge. The claims Descartes makes seem kinda arbitrary and dogmatic with recent advancements in technology we see. More seriously is the problem of intrinsic qualities of sensations or the specific semantical contents of our beliefs and desires. We'll go over materialist responses later, but until we do the dualist will retain a bargaining chip here.
4. The psychological phenomena shit is obviously retarded. It's an instance of the above argument but for disputed phenomena.

# Arguments Against Dualism
---
1. *Simplicity.* It is a [[Systematizing the theoretical virtues|principle of rational methodology]], if all else is equal, the simpler of two competing hypotheses should be preferred. The materialist postulates only one kind of substance and one class of properties, whereas the dualist postulates two kinds of substances and/or two kinds of properties. And to no evident explanatory advantages, charges the materialist. This isn't a decisive point, since *neither* dualism nor materialism can yet explain all of the phenomena to be explained. But the objection has some force, since there is no doubt at all that physical matter exists (and plays a substantial role in our internal cognitive activities) while spiritual matter remains a primitive, tenuous, and explanatorily feebly hypothesis. This argument relies on the dualistic hypothesis not bringing some definite explanatory advantage obtainable in no other way. This brings us to the second objection.
2. *Explanatory Impotence*.
