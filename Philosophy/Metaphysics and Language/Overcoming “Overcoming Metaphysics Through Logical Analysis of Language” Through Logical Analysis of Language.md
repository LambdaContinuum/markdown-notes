Before we can discuss the relation of metaphysics to science, we have to ascertain that there is such a thing as metaphysics that could bear a relation to science.

The problem of the possibility of metaphysics is defined on one natural interpretation: Can human thought alone, unaided by empirical evidence produce interesting knowledge? Aristotle's answer was a yes.

For Aristotle, to think of X is for one's soul to take on the form of X. Aristotle intends for this to be taken literally; an instantiation of a form in one's soul is on par with its realizations elsewhere. From this it follows that any necessary connection between forms can be perceived by realizing them in one's mind. If the form of Y necessarily accompanies the form of X, then it is necessarily realized in my mind as soon as I managed to think of X, i.e., as soon as the form of X is realized in my soul.

It is thus seen that, even though Aristotle was an empiricist, his reliance on experience was of a very special kind. Empirical input is needed only to enable me as it were to assemble the right forms in mind from bits and pieces given to me by sense-experience. Empirical evidence is not needed to ascertain natural laws, that is, necessary connections between forms.

This way of thinking is reflected in Aristotle's idea that induction or properly speaking, *epagoge*, is essentially a matter of concept formation, not of generalization from particulars to universals.

Aristotle's way of thinking shows in which sense the possibility of metaphysics was unproblematic in what sense it was problematic for him. The problem for Aristotle was not whether unaided human thought can recognize general truths. The problem was whether there is any subject matter left to metaphysics over and above the subject matter of the different particular sciences. Aristotle argued for an affirmative answer by arguing that a completely general science, a science of "being qua being", is possible

The Aristotelian foundation of metaphysics has been given up fairly universally. The rejection of the Aristotelian theory did not put an end to other forms of the belief that we somehow could reach substantial truths by means of pure thinking alone. Other metaphysical assumptions concerning the world may serve the same purpose as Aristotle's psychology of thought. One such source of truths was intuition. But the 90s marked the effective end of intuitionistic metaphysics.

Has metaphysics been found impossible? No. One can still argue, as Kant in effect did, that pure (i.e. nonempirical thought) can reveal the way in which our knowledge is grounded in our own thinking, in our own activities, and in the conceptual tools they're using. One interested variant of this critical metaphysics is Collingwood's idea that metaphysics is "the attempt to find out what absolute presuppositions have been made by this or that person or group of persons, on this or that occasion or groups of occasions". Whether it was always called metaphysics, such an examination of the basic conceptual assumptions of particular sciences or thought at large seem to be big business even in the twentieth century.

Even the possibility of critical metaphysics has been denied in our century. The classic document in this respect is Rudolf Carnap's 1931 paper. In it, Carnap relied in effect on two theses.:
1. A sharp separation of empirical and conceptual truths
2. an interpretation of conceptual truths are being vacuous (tautological).

The former thesis relegates metaphysics to the study of merely our conceptual systems, and the latter deprives metaphysics of any substantial subject matter. For statements about what our words and phrases mean are on this view empty or "tautological". To deny one is merely to talk nonsense, and to assert one therefore is not to make a meaningful statement. *Finis* metaphysics.

There's relatively little else in Carnap's philosophy that ruled out some sort of critical metaphysics. Aristotle's problem of whether there can be a general study of being as being was no difficulty for a defender of the unity of science and of the physicalist language as the universal language of science.

*Prima facie* refuting Carnapian denial of the possibility of metaphysics is a seriously out of date enterprise. The theses on which Carnap's attempted rejection rests have been rejected by a number of prominent philosophers.

First, Quine and others began to challenge Carnap's sharp dichotomy of questions of fact and questions of meaning. Quine's rejection of the analytic-synthetic distinction was an early form of the challenge. Later philosophers have in different ways defended the theory-ladenness and fact-ladenness of meaning. On such a view, now sharp distinction can be made between quesitons of facts and questions of meaning. Consequently, it's possible in principle that a conceptual analysis might uncover factual presuppositions of our language and our discourse. This opens the door to metaphysics at least in the "critical" sense.

Is Carnap or his critics right? Rather than answering whether there's sharp distinction between fact and meaning Hintikka will challenge the methodology the entire question. Suppose, for sake of argument, that meanings are theory-laden. Since meanings determine reference, the reference of a language user's words and phrases depend on the theory he or she has adopted or, more likely, the proto-theory his or her language community has tacitly developed.

Now how is such a matter to be studied? The first answer that comes to mind is the best. The obvious answer is by logical means. More precisely, by means of logical semantics. For what kinds of questions are we supposed to be studying here? Its fuzzy but the representative kind of question surely could be something like this: Given a theory $T[P]$ containing a term, say a one-place predicate $P$, what does it tell us about the applicability of $P$ to already different cases? Here $T[P]$ gives us a certain amount of information about some cases to which $P$ applies or does not apply, but it at most tells us about the relationships between $P$ and the other concepts employed in $T[P]$.
