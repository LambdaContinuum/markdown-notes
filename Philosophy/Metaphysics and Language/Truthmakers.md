## Introduction
---
Metaphysics is at least an attempt to build a theory that makes sense of many of the more abstract and general features of reality. Metaphysicians try to understand which things are fundamental, those thing's natures, and the fundamental way those things relate to one another. But where does one start such an endeavor?

Let's start with the mundane observation: we say and write lots of *truth-evaluable* things. We can put this mundane observation to work. Philosophers have longer argued about how to understand the nature of truth that is, they've argued about how it is that a sentence comes out true or false.

Aristotle in his *Metaphysics*:

> \[Thus] we define what the true and the false are. To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true. Metaphysics 1011b25–8 (Aristotle 1984: 1597)

Aristotle might naturally be taken to be suggesting that a sentence is true whenever the world is the way that the sentence says it is. The sentence "Grass is green" is true if and only if grass really is green. Any view of truth that incorporated this suggestion as a central feature is a *Correspondence Theory of Truth*.

> [!box_name] Correspondence Theory
> A Correspondence Theory is one that claims a sentence is true if and only if there is a match, a correspondence, between what a sentence says and the world. Different Correspondence Theories are distinguished by their respective takes on what correspondence consists in.

There is two sides to the simple correspondence story.
1. The first side involves the sentence and what it says about the world.
2. The second side is the world itself.

### Propositions
The first way that a discussion of truth gets one going in metaphysics is via its connection to *propositions*. Propositions are the meanings of (many, most, or all) assertoric (indicative) sentences and are the objects of belief and knowledge. The idea is that a sentence token, say a token utterance of "Grass is green" expresses a proposition, that Grass is green. The proposition represents the world as being a certain way.

If the world is as the proposition represents the world as being, then the proposition is true and, thereby, so is the sentence token that expressed it.  

Propositions are standardly taken to be both *non-linguistic* and *representational*. These two features are crucial to propositions playing their characteristic roles in language and thought.

To motivate the idea that propositions must be *non-linguistic*, consider the possibility of not introducing propositions at all. You might think that sentences can do anything that propositions can do, like being the contents of language and though and being the fundamental bearers of truth-value. There are two reasons why philosophers have thought it necessary to posit propositions in addition to sentences, and both reasons plausibly demand a non-linguistic object to serve as the content of language and thought.

1. Sentences in different languages can mean the same thing.
2. Native speakers of different languages can share belief contents.

Two people who speak different languages can express the same idea. For example, 'Grass is green' means in English just what 'L'herbe est verte' means in French. These two sentences express the same proposition. If this is the case in general, then sentences cannot themselves function as meanings because sentences are language-bound but meanings appear not to be.

If propositions were language-bound objects the English sentence in 'Grass is green' would express an English-proposition and the French sentence would express a French-proposition. This cannot be right, for the same reason that sentences cannot function as meanings: these two sentences express the same proposition.

In addition to being non-linguistic, propositions must *represent* the world. Propositions have representational properties in virtue of which they can be accurate or inaccurate. Beliefs and sentences represent the world in virtue of their relationships to propositions. Beliefs are true or false because they have propositions as their content.

1. Propositions represent what they do independently of the intentions of conscious agents.
2. Propositions do not represent by being similar to that which is represented.

A few metaphysical questions arise:
- How is it that propositions represent what they do?
- What exactly are propositions?

For the latter, we've identified two features that constrain what sort of thing a proposition is. They must be non-linguistic and representation. Further, we have given propositions two roles to play, being the meaning of assertoric sentences and the contents of belief. This leaves open what sort of non-linguistic representation thing propositions are.

Philosophers have taken a number of views about the true nature of propositions.
- Some claim they're fundamental abstract objects
	- Among those who take this view, some maintain that propositions have no internal structure and have primitive representational features
	- Others maintain that propositions have some sort of quasi-linguistic structure and represent what they do because of this structure
- Others claim that propositions are certain sorts of fact in the world, like facts about which objects have which features, or which objects are related to which other objects or facts about objects and features of objects in combination with facts about some language or other.
- Others claim that propositions are just arbitrary classes of possible worlds.
There are pluses and minuses to each of these views, however which view of propositions one takes will not have a substantial impact on how our discussion proceeds from here on out.

To summarize, we can articulate a simple and basic theory of propositions. Propositions are:
1. Abstract (immaterial, not located in space or time).
2. Capable of being true or false.
3. Capable of being believed, doubted, considered or assumed.
4. Capable of being expressed by simple indicative statements.
5. Things that stand in various logical or quasi-syntactic relations to other propositions.
6. Things that contain one or more *concepts*, either individual or general, where concepts are also abstract things that stand in some sort of intentional relation to some particular thing, general property, or class of things.

### Truthmakers
What about the world side of the correspondence story? The central question concerns what propositions must correspond to in order to be true. It seems clear that we shouldn't say a proposition must correspond to the *whole* of the world in order to be true. Consider the proposition grass is green. It shouldn't take the whole world for that proposition to come out true.

There was a tradition in the 19th century that would claim that in an important sense, every truth was necessarily connected to every truth. These British Idealists and Hegelians believed the world was a single, interconnected, inseparable whole. These philosophers were *holists*. Holists maintain that the interconnection of the world is so persuasive that if one truly understands one part of reality, one thereby understands the whole of reality. Because of this interconnectedness, any sentence must correspond to the whole world in order to be true.

The early part of the 20th century saw a strong reaction against holism, led prominently by Russell and Wittgenstein. These philosophers argued that holism failed to conform to common sense and to our best scientific practices and that there must be a set of fundamental, logically independent facts, the "logical atoms".

Two facts $a$ and $b$ are logically independent if and only if all four of the following are possible:
1. $a$ and $b$ both exist
2. neither $a$ not $b$ exists
3. $a$ exists but $b$ doesn't
4. $b$ exists but $a$ doesn't

Logical atoms, according to logical atomists, were the proper parts of the world to which propositions must correspond in order to be true.

Logical atomists as well as other philosophers like Moore further developed the Correspondence Theory of Truth by asserting that facts are what *make* propositions true. In doing so, they build on an idea first expressed by Aristotle in his *Categories*:

> [I]f there is a man, the statement whereby we say that there is a man is true, and reciprocally—since if the statement whereby we say that there is a man is true, there is a man. And whereas the true statement is in no way the cause of the actual thing’s existence, the actual thing does seem in some way the cause of the statement’s being true: it is because the actual thing exists or does not that the statement is called true or false.” (Aristotle, Categories 14b15–22; 1984: 22)

Because the fact that grass is green is what makes the proposition that grass is green true, the fact that grass is green is a *truthmaker* for the proposition that grass is green.

> [!box_name] Definition D2.1 Classical Truthmakers.
> A thing $x$ is a (classical) *truthmaker* for proposition $p$ if and only if 
> 1. necessarily, if $x$ exists, then $p$ is true and
> 2. if $x$ exists and $p$ is true, then $p$ is true at least in part in virtue of $x$'s existence

What exactly are facts? We take up such a question when discussing particulars and the problem of Individuation.

Any view that believes there are things satisfying Def2.1 is a 'Classical Truthmaker Theory'

> [!box_name] 2.1T Classical Truthmaker Theory.
> There are classical truthmakers for all truths or for some very large sub-classes of truths.

> [!box_name] 2.1A No Classical Truthmakers.
> There are few, if any, truths with classical truthmakers.

Before we go over the varieties of classical truthmaker theory we should consider why we should believe in Classical Truthmaker Theory in the first place, as well as a fundamental challenge to the very foundation of truthmaker theory: the *deflationary* theory of truth.

## Five Arguments for Classical Truthmaker Theory
---
Why should we believe that there are truthmakers? Here are five arguments for truthmakers.

1. The correspondence theory of truth leads naturally to truthmakers.
	1. The Correspondence Theory of Truth is initially highly plausible. It makes sense of our usual ways of thinking about most truths. It also explains why it is that we investigate the world in order to ascertain whether a claim is true or not.
	2. The chunk of the world to which a proposition must correspond in order to be true satisfies clause 1 of the definition of a truth maker. The proposition that green is true simply cannot fail to be true if grass is in fact green.
	3. There seems to be an asymmetric dependence of the truth of a proposition on the chunk of the world to which that proposition must correspond. In other words, it's because grass is green that the proposition grass is green is true. But it doesn't seem like because the proposition that grass is green is true that grass is in fact green. This means the chunk the world to which a proposition must correspond in order to be true satisfies clause 2.  Let's approach this from another tack. The Correspondence Theory proposes that truth consists in a certain kind of relation between a proposition and some real thing or things. What kind of relation is truthful correspondence? We can ask if truthful correspondence is an internal relation? Moore articulated a distinction between internal and non-internal relations according which an internal relation is a relation $R$ which is such that, whether it holds of two entities, $x$ and $y$, depends on the intrinsic characters of $x$ and $y$ considered individually. Relations are non-internal if and only if they are not internal. An object's intrinsic character is determined by its intrinsic properties, where a property is intrinsic to an object if that object has the property because of the way it is or its parts are, rather than in relation to something that is not itself or its part. The class of internal relations include the relation of *being the same size as*, *being twice as tall as*, *being smarter than*, *contains more parts than*, etc. Consider the relation of *being smaller than*. To tell if one thing is smaller than another, all we need to know are the sixes of each two things, and size is an intrinsic property of a thing. Relations that are not internal include those of *being at least a meter apart from*, *being to the north of*, *is moving away from*, etc. If a relation is not internal, we have to know something beyond the intrinsic character of the two things to know if the relation holds. Truthful correspondence seems to be an internal relation. If we know everything there is to know about the intrinsic character of a proposition (including its content), and if we know everything there is to know about the intrinsic character of the part of the world that the proposition is about (its *worldly correlate*) we should able to tell whether the proposition is true or false. Moreover, the intrinsic character of the proposition is eternal and essential to it: propositions don’t vary intrinsically from one time or one situation to another. So, the truth of the proposition must depend on the character of its worldly correlate. This is exactly the asymmetric dependency of the truth on the world that Aristotle mentions in the Categories, and it is why we find it natural to speak of ‘truthmakers’. Therefore, the Correspondence Theory is a theory about what truth consists in. For a proposition to be true is for that proposition to be in the truthful correspondence relation to some part of the world, its worldly correlate. So, we should be able to say something like "(1) For $p$ to be true is for $p$ to stand in the truthful correspondence relation to the worldly correlate of $p$." Since the relation is an internal relation, for some proposition $p$ to stand in this relation to something is just for that thing to have the right kind of intrinsic character. So we should be able to say the following, where $X$ stands for the intrinsic character or property: "(2) For $p$ to be true is for the worldly correlate of $p$ to be $X$." 

> [!box_name] Def D2.2 Internal Relation.
> $R$ is an *internal relation* if and only if, necessarily, for every $x$ and $y$, whether $R$ holds between $x$ and $y$ depends only on the intrinsic properties of $x$ and of $y$.
> 

> [!box_name] Def D2.3 Intrinsicality.
> $x$ is intrinsically $F$ if and only if nothing that is not $x$ or a part of $x$ is part of the [[Grounding, Ontological Dependence, and Fundamentality|ground]] of $x$'s being $F$.

2. Without truthmakers we would be unable to discern whether theories differ with respect to what they say about the world. It is difficult to mark the difference between ontologically distinct theories and theories that differ only ideologically without appealing to truthmakers. This gives us some reason to think that there are truthmakers, since it is clear that we can tell whether theories are ontologically distinct or are merely ideologically distinct.
3. Truthmaker Theory is needed to rule out metaphysical “cheaters.” Some philosophers have argued that without truthmakers we have no way to combat theories which help themselves to putative truths without wanting to say anything metaphysically serious about the bits of the world to which those truths correspond.
4. Truthmaker Theory can provide an explanation of possible truth. Ludwig Wittgenstein, in his *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* employed truthmakers (in the form of states of affairs) as a way of explaining what it is for propositions to be possibly true. Suppose that each of the truthmakers is utterly separate and independent from the others. If so, it would seem natural to think that the existence or non-existence of each truthmaker has nothing to do with the existence or non-existence of the others. We could assign the values ‘Exists’ or ‘Does not exist’ to each possible truthmaker without reference to the assignment of these same values to the others. Consequently, every permutation of such values would represent a real possibility. This Tractarian account of possibility is sometimes called ‘Combinatorialism’ (15.3T), since each combination of logical atoms constitutes a real possibility.
5.  Truthmakers as causes and effects. Some truths causally explain other truths. Causation seems to be non-circular: facts don’t causally explain themselves. One account of causation takes it to be a relation of a certain kind between truthmakers.

## The Challenge of Deflationism
---
One of the motivations for truthmaker theory is the Correspondence Theory of Truth. It's not clear we need the theory. Many philosophers defend a *minimal* or *deflationary* conception of true, in which the predicate "is true" is explicated entirely in terms of Tarski's truth-schema.

3. 'Snow is white' is true if and only if snow is white.
4. 'Grass is green' is true if and only if grass is green.

According to such accounts to say that some sentence $S$ is true is simply to assert $S$ indirectly. We might say that everything Einstein said about relativity was true. To do so is not ascribe some sort of property to Einstein's statements or to claim that these statements *correspond* somehow to reality or the facts. It's simply to endorse those statements, to commit oneself as if one had asserted those very things.

Deflationists are only anti-realists about one thing: the existence of a real property of truth. A commitment to deflationism involves only a commitment to the unreality of a metaphysically special property of truth and of metaphysically fundamental facts involving the truth of propositions.

The form of deflationism that is relevant to truthmaker theory is a metaphysical thesis: the thesis that there is no real property of truth (or of falsity). For deflationists, true propositions have nothing in common with one another.

The thinness of deflationist truth disqualifies truth from playing certain kinds of explanatory roles. Truth as such cannot figure (for deflationists) in any causal or metaphysical explanation, nor can it appear in a causal law or other law of nature.

There have been five major objections:
1. The methodology of science requires truth as a natural property. In science and other forms of inquiry, we are always trying to find methods, practices, and authorities that are reliable sources of information. We take our experience with science to provide us with “projectible" generalizations, to use the term introduced by Nelson Goodman. A projectible generalization must, as Goodman pointed out, make use of projectible predicates. We can make inferences about the future using predicates like “green” but not bizarrely gerrymandered predicates like Goodman’s “grue". Lewis has argued that projectible predicates are those that signify natural properties. Since deflationists deny that truth is natural, they must deny that we can make projectible generalizations about truth, including generalizations about the relative reliability of various sources and methods.
2. The pursuit of truth is constitutive of belief and inquiry. Many philosophers have recognized that the pursuit of the truth is a norm for certain kinds of cognition and uses of language. We are supposed to aim at truth when we make assertions, form beliefs or decide upon methods of inquiry. It seems that the pursuit of truth is a special kind of norm: a constitutive or essential norm. It is of the very essence of assertion and belief that they aim at truth. The property of pursuing the truth is a part or constituent of the power of believing, and the property of truth is a constituent of the pursuit of the truth.
3. The property of truth is needed to account for truth-value gaps. Some apparent assertions fail to be either true or false. Such assertions suffer from truth-value gaps. In order to avoid this argument, deflationists have to restrict the application of Tarski’s schema to those sentences that succeed in expressing a proposition. However, deflationists would then owe some account of what a proposition is. It would seem to be part of the very essence or nature of a proposition that it be true or false, and such a metaphysical account of propositions would again require truth to be a natural property.
4. A property of truth is required for the contextualist solution to the Paradox of the Liar.
5. The theory of truth is not a conservative extension of truth-free theories.

## Truth Supervenes on Being
---
There is a radical way of replacing individual truthmaking with plural or joint truthmaking. This view drops the truthmaking relation entirely and makes use instead of the idea of weak supervenience. Truth Supervenes on Being (TSB) is such a view. TSB claims that there is a special class of ultimately real or fundamental entities $E$ and a special class of natural or fundamental properties and relations $N$, and that the fundamental propositions are those atomic predications involving only fundamental entities and natural relations.

> [!box_name]  Def D2.4 Weak Supervenience.
> A set of properties $A$ *weakly supervenes* on a set of properties $B$ if and only if it's impossible for any two worlds to agree on which things have which $B$-properties but to disagree about which things have which $A$-properties. That is, two situation that are indiscernible in respect of the $B$-properties must also be indiscernible in respect to the $A$-properties.

> [!box_name] Truth Supervenes on Being (TSB)
> The property of *being true* weakly supervenes on the property of being a truth about what thing exist and about exactly which natural properties they have and which natural relations they stand in.

TSB prohibits any fundamental truth that does not involve actually (don't they mean concretely?) existing things. The bite of TSB depends on the content of the idea of natural properties and relations. If just any relation is natural, then TSB ceases to be a substantive doctrine. 

There are motivations but honestly all this talk strikes me as mysterious and unhelpful.
