## Necessity and Contingency
- A true statement is *necessary* if it could not have been false
- A true statement is *contingent* if it could have been false

Some philosophers have agreed that 'necessary' means not but 'a priori' and 'contingent' means nothing but 'a posteriori'. However this conflation of the two distinctions is now widely rejected. Nearly all philosophers have been persuaded by Kripke's book *Naming and Neccessity* that the *metaphysical* distinction between necessary and contingent is different from the *epistemic* distinction between a priori and a posteriori.

According to Kripke, not all necessities are a priori, there are some *a posteriori necessities*. And not all contingencies are a posteriori, there also some *contingent a prioris*.

## A Posteriori Necessities
Could I have had different parents? Surely not. A person with different parents would not have been me. So it's necessary that My parent's were my (mom and dads name).

Consider the proposition *Hydrogen is made of atoms containing one electron*. This is surely necessary too. *Hydrogen* couldn't have had a different atomic structure. Anything with a different atomic structure wouldn't be hydrogen. But this statement is obviously a posteriori (?)  Physicists didn't figure out the structure of hydrogen by sitting in an armchair.

Perhaps the most obvious example of a posteriori necessities are simple identities involving proper names. *Marilyn Monroe is Norma Jeane Baker*. This is necessary, Marilyn Monroe couldnâ€™t not have been Norma Jeane Baker. That would require her somehow not to have been herself, which is absurd. But *Marilyn Monroe is Norma Jeane Baker* is not a priori. Somebody could understand this statement perfectly well and yet not know it's true.

## A Priori Contingencies
Kripke gives an example involving the platinum rod in Paris that once defined the metre as a unit of length. Given this definition, it was a priori that *The Paris platinum rod is one meter long*. We could know this without further ado, give that the rod provided the standard for determining what a meter is.

But this statement seems contingent. That rod might well have been shorter than a metre, if its manufacturer had chosen to make it so. There seems to be some trickery going on so let's give a clearer example.

Suppose we're interested in who invented the zip. We got bored having to say "the inventor of the zip" so we adopt the name "Julius" to refer to the inventor of the zip. Now given this convention, the statement that "Julius invented the zip" is surely a priori, but it is not necessary. Julius might have been dropped on his head when little and grown up too stupid to invent the zip.

The statement *Julius invented the zip* could well have been false if things turned out differently.

## Essential Properties
Possible worlds must respect the essential properties of things. Some properties of things are *essential*, others are *accidental*. Hydrogen essentially has atoms with one electron but is only accidentally used to make bombs.

Statements ascribing essential properties to things are necessary truths. It's necessary that *David Papineau is the child of Owen and Constance Papineau*, and necessary that *David Papineau is a human being*.

Note the necessity of these statements does not make David Papineau a necessary being. It's possible for them to failed to exist. The best way to deal with this is to recognize that necessary truths ascribing essential properties to contingent beings are implicitly conditional. If you think about it, what is really necessary is that if *David Papineau exists, then he is a human being*, not that *David Papineau (exists and) is a human being*. 

## Two Readings of Statements of Necessity
Consider a statement like:

1. The inventor of the zip necessarily invented the zip.

This can be read two ways:

2. It is necessary that the inventor of the zip invented the zip

Which means, in all possible worlds, the person who invented the zip, whoever that may be, invented the zip. (2) is obviously true, it would be a contradiction to deny.

3. The inventor of the zip necessarily invented the zip.

Now we focus on the actual inventor of the zip, the person who invented the zip in the actual world. It's clear this is false, the actual inventor of the zip could have hit his head and been too stupid to invent the zip.

## Scope Distinction
This kind of ambiguity is called a *scope* distinction. Consider the statement *every girl loves a sailor*. This can be read saying:

1. For every girl, there is a sailor (possibly different for each girl) whome that girl loves
2. There is a certain sailor whom every girl loves

More explicitly:

1. (for all girls x)(there exists a sailor y such that)(x loves y).
2. (There exists a sailor y such that)(for all girls x)(x loves y).

In the first case, the expression '(for each)' has a *wide scope* and the expression '(there exists)' has a *narrow scope*. In the second case this is reversed. Now return to our two readings of *The inventor of the zip necessarily invented the zip*. In a more explicit notation:

2. (Necessarily)(the inventor of the zip)(invented the zip)
3. (The inventor of the zip)(necessarily)(invented the zip)

In (2) the prefix '(Necessarily)' has wide scope while the description '(the inventor of the zip)' has narrow scope. In (3) the description has wide scope while the prefix has narrow scope.

## Julius and the Inventor of the Zip
Recall the name 'Julius' defined as 'the inventor the zip'. It was said that *Julius invented the zip* is clearly contingent (given that Julius could have been dropped on his head ...). That is, it was said that the statement is definitely false:

4. Julius necessarily invented the zip.

How come this is definitely false, rather than ambiguous between a true and false reading? We started by saying *the inventor of the zip necessarily invented the zip* is ambiguous between a true and false reading, but (1) and (1) must mean the same thing, since 'Julius' was explicitly defined as 'the inventor of the zip'.

There is a difference between (4) and (1). Even though 'Julius' was defined as the inventor of the zip, it remains the case that 'Julius' is a *proper name*, where 'the inventor of the zip' is a *description*. This difference explains why (4) is false, while (1) is ambigous. The fact that 'Julius' is a proper name *forces* us to read (4) as about the person who invented the zip in the actual world, and so as akin to the reading of (1) in which 'the inventor of the zip' has wide scope and 'necessarily' has narrow scope.

## Rigid Designators

^58edcf

Proper names are terms for people, places, and other important objects - like 'David', 'London', 'Titanic', and so on. They are typically written with capital letters, and their function is to pick out some individual, rather than convey descriptive information about it.

That's why in modal statements they always work like descriptions with wide scope. We cannot help but understand modal statements made using proper names as first identifying some object and then saying what is necessary or possible about it.

Words that always work like this in modal statements are called '*[[Necessity and Possibility|rigid designators]]*'.  Proper names are the most obvious examples of rigid designators. But there are arguably other species of this genus. Many philosophers think the names of scientific categories, like 'hydrogen', 'water', 'tiger', and so on, are also rigid designators.

It is sometimes said that 'rigid designators have their referents necessarily' but this can be confusing. The idea is not that the *word* 'David Papineau' necessarily names the author, this is obviously false. They could easily have been given a different name.

Rather the idea is that the name as used in the actual world picks out a certain actual individual, and in modal statements must still be understood as talking about the same individual and saying what is necessary or possible about it.

## The Causal Theory of Reference
The idea of rigid designation was introduced by Kripke in the book *Naming and Necessity*. Part of the purpose of the book was to show that proper names are rigid designators, but Kripke also defended another view about proper names, referred to as the 'Causal theory of Reference'.

The 'causal theory of reference' is a theory of how names get related to their bearers in the actual world. It's opposed to the more traditional 'description theory' according to which a name refers to what ever entity satisfies the descriptions people associate with the name.

Kripke argued that the description theory gives the wrong account of how proper names get their references fixed. Names don't normally get hooked on to their bearers by being associated with a set of descriptions. It's much simpler. There is some original occasion where the individual in question is first named (most obviously, the baptism of a child). Thereafter the name spreads through the community. As a result, all those who later use the name will be referring to the individual originally dubbed with it, even if those later users lack descriptive knowledge of that individual. (The 'causal' in the name of the theory alludes to the way the name spreads *causally* through the community, with later users acquiring the name through causal contact with earlier users.)

## Rigidity and the Causal Theory
The causal theory of reference is not the same as the doctrine that proper names are rigid designators. The former is a thesis about the way names get attached to their bearers in the actual world. The latter is a thesis about the way names behave in modal statements. The two theses are distinct.

Recall our 'Julius' example is a name that is cooked up to fit the description theory of reference. The description theory is true of 'Julius' even if it fails for other names. But 'Julius' is still a rigid designator. It simply follows from the fact that 'Julius' is a proper name that is rigidly designates.

However, the causal theory of reference does require rigid designation.  A referring term is *non-rigid* if what is refers to at a different possible world is independent of what it refers to at the actual world. Descriptions for example, are non-rigid.

This kind of non-rigid reference requires that the referring term in question has some descriptive content that can be satisfied by different objects in different possible worlds. 

So, if proper names have their references fixed causally, and not by association with descriptions, it is hard to see how they could behave in this non-rigid way. They have no option, so to speak, but to refer rigidly, in all modal contexts, to the thing that they name in the actual world.

## De Dicto and De Re
Recall that there are no possible worlds that are logically contradiction and no possible worlds such that things lack their essential properties.

Corresponding to these two limits are two kinds of modal statements. There are *'de dicto'* modal statements which answer to the requirements of logic and there are *'de re'* modal statements which are concerned with whether specific things have certain properties essentially or not.

*De dicto* modal statements are ones which contain no rigid designators, and in which the necessarily or possibly prefix takes wide scope. They're called *'de dicto'*, 'of word', because the truth or falsity of these statements hinges on the descriptions involved, and not on what those descriptions refer to in the actual world.

*De re* modal statements are those in which 'necessarily' or 'possibly' prefix takes narrow scope, or which contains rigid designation. They're called *'de re'*, 'of the thing', because now we are focusing on some specific thing in the actual world, and asking whether it necessarily or possibly has some property, however that thing might be described.

## Necessary and A Priori Again
If we stick purely to de dicto statements, we can expect necessity and a priority to line up together. For a de dicto necessary statement to be true, all possible worlds must conform to some purely descriptive requirement. This could only be true if the descriptive requirement were guaranteed to be true by logic and definitions. So such statements will be knowable a priori.

But once we switch to de re statements, then necessity and a priority can come apart. This is the source of Kripke's examples of a priori contingencies and a posteriori necessities.

First, consider a priori contingencies. These arise when we identify the relevant entity in a way that makes it *a priori* that it has some *accidental* property. For example, it's a priori that the inventor of the zip, Julius, invented the zip. But inventing the zip is not a necessary property of that person.

Consider a posteriori necessities. These arise when we identify something in a way that makes it *a posteriori* that it has some *essential* property. For example, it's a posteriori that the first mammal on the moon was human. But membership of the human species is necessary to the first mammal on the moon (namely, Neil Armstrong).

The point is that the accidentality or essentiality of a property ascribed to some entity is *independent* of whether or not we identify that entity in a way that makes it a priori that it possess that property

So why is there a possible world where it's that *Julius did not invent the zip*? This statement is a priori contradictory, it's falsity is guaranteed by the definition of *Julius*. Shouldn't such possibility be ruled out?

Well, there is no possible world in which somebody both does and doesn't invent the zip. But that's not the kind of possibility required to make it true that *Julius* did not invent the zip. There is no contradiction in this latter possibility because it's possible that Julius lack the property of inventing the zip, even though we use this accidental property to identify him in this world.

Look at it like this. Even though we identify Julius in this world as the person who invented the zip, we throw away this information, when we consider the possible world where it is true that he doesn't invent the zip. The way we identify Julius in this world a priori guarantees the actual-world truth of Julius invented the zip. But because this accidental fact about Julius isn't carried over to other possible worlds, there can be some where it is false the Julius invented the zip.

## A Limit to Skepticism about A Posteriori Necessity
It's been taken for granter that there is a distinction between accidental and essential properties of things. My parentage is essential to me but not my profession. It's atomic structure is essential to hydrogen, but not the fact that it can be used to make bombs.

Some philosophers are unsure about the distinction between essential and accidental properties, and accordingly tend to be uneasy about examples of a posteriori necessities. So a common response to examples of a posteriori necessity is to query whether parents really are necessary to humans, or whether atomic structure really is necessary to chemical elements.

There are limits to this kind of skepticism about a posteriori necessity. Consider true identity claims made using different proper names, they are clearly a posteriori necessities.

Consider this argument:

1. Necessarily Norma Jeane Baker = Norma Jeane Baker
2. Since proper names are rigid designators, this is a de re claim about the actual Norma Jeane Baker, saying that she necessarily has the property of being identical to Norma Jeane Baker
3. But Norma Jeane Baker = Marilyn Monroe
4. So, by the Indiscernibility of Identicals, every property of Norma Jeane Baker is a property of Marilyn Monroe and vice versa.
5. So in particular, Marilyn Monroe must share with Norma Jeane Baker the property identified in (2), of being necessarily identical to Norma Jeane Baker.
6. So necessarily Marilyn Monroe = Norma Jeane Baker

And this last claim then gives us an a posteriori necessity, since it's certainly not a priori that Marilyn Monroe is identical to Norma Jeane Baker.

Clearly this argument can be repeated, with any true identity statement involving two different names, to make a case that any such statement is necessary and a posteriori.

Such arguments only carry force with identity claims, because the first premise would be contentious if it involved some claim about origin or constitution.
