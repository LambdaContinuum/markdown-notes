# Names and Descriptions
---
There's a distinction between two kinds of linguistic expression: proper names and descriptions.

1. Descriptions:
	1. Indefinite descriptions are descriptions that do not purport to pick out any particular thing. These apply to anything which fit the description, and there may be more than one thing that fits. For example, 'a reader' or 'a president'.
	2. Definite descriptions purport to pick out exactly one particular thing. For example, 'the capital of france'.
2. Proper names attempt to pick out a particular thing, yet unlike definite descriptions the pick something out apparently without describing that thing. That's what people like John Stuart Mill believed anyways,

On Mill's view using a proper name to pick something out does not provide any information about whatever has been picked out. Names, according to Mill, are 'simply marks'.

# The Puzzle of Informative Identity Sentences
---
Frege poses the following problem for Mill's theory of names. How can there be informative identity sentences?

Suppose the meaning of a name consists solely in what unique object it picks. It follows that two names that pick out the same object will have the same meaning. So if 'a' and 'b' are named of the same object, 'a' will have the same meaning as 'b'.

If 'a' and 'b' have the same meaning, then any sentences involving one of these names will have the same meaning. If sentences have the same meaning, then they will convey the same information to those who understand them. This generates the following puzzle. The identity sentence 'a = b' can be more informative than the identity sentence 'a = a', since 'a = a' is obviously and trivially true, whereas 'a = b' need not be obvious or trivial.  It can tell us something we don't know.

Since 'a = b'  can be more informative than 'a = a', these identity sentences can not have the same meaning. But the only source for this difference could be a difference in the meanings of 'a' and 'b'.

Consider the following sentences:
1. $6 \div 3 = 6 \div 4$
2. $6 \div 4 = \sqrt{4}$

They are identity sentences. The expressions refer to the same number, that is 2. But whereas what (1) says is trivial, what (5) says is more informative. But if the linguistic role of these expressions consists solely in referring to a certain number, then it's difficult to see how these sentences could differ in informativeness.

Also consider the following:
1. Phosphorus = Phosphorus
2. Hesperus = Hesperus
3. Hesperus = Phosphorus

We can know *a priori* that (1) and (2) are true, but it isn't knowable *a priori* that (3). If the meanings of names are just what they refer to, it's not clear how this can be the case.

# Frege on Names
---
Frege called the expressions flanking the identity signs 'proper names'. Frege takes a proper name to be any expression that refers to a single object. This means Frege also regards definite descriptions as proper names.

Frege introduces objects as the referents of proper names, rather than introducing proper names as those expressions which refer to objects. His thinking is that we can identify which expressions are proper names before having to consider what those expressions are names of.

Frege's methodology of taking the notion of a proper name to be explanatorily prior to the notion of object has been adopted by various other philosophers. Some of them propose what they call 'the syntactic priority thesis' according to which our understanding of ontological categories, such as the notion of an object, is determined by our understanding of syntactic categories, such as the notion of a proper name.
