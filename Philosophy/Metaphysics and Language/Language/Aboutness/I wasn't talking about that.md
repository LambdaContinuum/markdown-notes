# Excuses

You'll note that people will sometimes say stuff but not be concerned that what they're saying is strictly speaking is false. The observation that's made is that, in some contexts, its enough that a same is *partly true*. True in what is says about the subject matter under discussion.

# Puritanism
---
The idea of being *partly* true is apt to arouse suspicion. The phrase itself is perfectly fine English, Greek as well, the creation myth in Phaedrus is described by Socrates as "partly true and tolerably credible".

He tells a story given by a psychoanalyst. The general idea is that if we don't integrate the idea that some things can be both good and bad, the result is cognitive style known as "black and white" thinking.

We're fine with such behavior in kids, but it has a reputation as negative and pathological within adults. But our assessment shifts from the Good to the True, where the "paranoid-schizoid" position of demanding to know whether a statement is true or false full stop is healthy minded and not pathological.

A theme here will be defending partial truth.

# Partial Truth as Truth Of a Part
---
There are to questions: What is partial truth? Why would we settle for it? The second question will be answered later. The quick answer is there are areas where if it wasn't for partial truth, we wouldn't have any truth at all.

What is it for a hypothesis to be partly true? The naivest idea about this:
1. A hypothesis is partly true iff it has parts that are wholly true.

We must ask what it means to be part of a hypothesis. The naivest idea about such a relation is:
2. One hypothesis is part of another iff it's implied by the others.

A includes B just if it implies B. This naive idea is on the right track. But the idea is questionable.

A paradigm of inclusion is the relation that simple conjunctions bear to their conjuncts—the relation *Snow is white and expensive* bears to *Snow is white*. A paradigm of non-inclusion is the relation disjuncts bear to disjunctions; *Snow is white* does not have *Snow is white or expensive* as a part. On (2), disjuncts imply their disjunctions every bit as conjunctions imply their conjucts, so there must be more to inclusion than implication.

This is a paradigm case, and the intuitions here are systematic. A number of things suggest that parthood has an explanatory role that requires more than mere implication. (See book)

More must be involved in B's being part of A than B's being implied by A; What is the X such that *Parthood = implication + X*?

The examples given suggest the answer is that a statements parts are identified in all of these cases by looking for an implication whose subject matter is part of the subject matter of the original statement. *Grass is green* does not include *Grass is green or radioactive* because the latter brings in the matter of radioactivity, which is absent from *Grass is green*/

Content inclusion is implication plus subject-matter inclusion. Both of these are relations in which a semantically important property is preserved: truth, in the one case, and aboutness, in the other. The proposal can be put as follows:

3. B is part of A iff the inference from A to B is
	1. truth-preserving—A implies B.
	2. aboutness-preserving—A's subject matter includes that of B.

For this to work we need a notion of *overall sentential subject matter*—of what a sentence is overall about—such that each sentence winds up with just one of them. There has to be such a thing as *the subject matter of S*.

# Aboutness in History
---
Identifying content will require us broaden our focus from truth conditions to what sentences are about, their subject matters.

A sentence's truth conditions underdetermine its subject matter; they can be arrived at via any number of reference-assignments, as long as compensating changes are made in the interpretation of predicates.

# Summary
---
Partial truth may strike us as sneaky, unclean, the last refuge of a scoundrel. But, whether a statement is partly true may be all that we want to know. A statement S is partly true insofar as it has wholly true parts: wholly true implications whose subject matter is included in that of S. An account of subject matter will be needed, and of the relation that sentences bear to their subject matters, "aboutness", if we want to understand partial truth.

Aboutness has been somewhat neglected, but not entirely; think of Frege on identity, Kripke on counterparts, van Fraassen on empirical adequacy, Yalcin on epistemic modals, and Hempel on confirmation.

Subject matter is an independent factor in meaning, over and above truth-conditional content. Not completely independent, for what a sentence is about is tied up with its ways of being true and false.
