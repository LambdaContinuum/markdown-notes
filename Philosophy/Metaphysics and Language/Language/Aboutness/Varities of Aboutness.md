# Existing Proposals

A few philosophers have attempted to think systematically about subject matter. Gilbert Ryle starts in his paper "About". Goodman attempts to improve on Ryle in 1961. The most thorough account to date is David Lewis's in "Statements Partly about Observation".

Ryle proposes a sentence is about what it mentions, where it to mention an item 𝚔 is to contain a word or phrase *k* that designates it. So *Jones climbed Helvellyn* is about Jones and Helvellyn, because it contains *Jones* and *Helvellyn*. 

Ryle needs to extend this account, because it has *Jones climbed Helvellyn* having the same aboutness-properties as *Jones mined Helvellyn*.

Goodman objects that a statement is not only about what is mentioned in it. *Everyone has their secrets* is in part about the author, despite not containing any expressions designating the author. *Maine is prosperous* is about New England, though nothing in it designated New England.

Goodman's first proposal is: *S* is about 𝚔 if 𝚔 is mentioned either in S or in a statement R it suitably implies. This solves the above problems, but it's too powerful. *Maine is prosperous* implies statements mentioning whatever you like. S must "suitably" imply a statement mentioning 𝚔. Suitable implication is selective implication; *S* should imply *R(k)* without implying *R(x)* holds for every x.

Each sentence S is, in Goodman's view, about a *lot* of things. Recall we need a *single* subject matter, call it 𝚜, to slot into our [[I wasn't talking about that|proposed definition (3)]] of content-part. 

There's a difficulty to approaches that try to build S's subject matter up out of the items mentioned in it. A sentence's subject matter has to do with what it says; and what it says depends not just on the words employed, but how the words are ordered.

How about: the subject matter of S is the (smallest?) 𝚖 such that facts about 𝚖 determine whether the sentence is true.

Here's the problem, the question of when a fact is about such and such is not much easier than the corresponding question about sentences. Maybe what we're after is an item whose intrinsic properties determine truth-value, similar to how the nineteenth century's intrinsic properties settle the truth-value of sentences entirely about goings on in that century.

𝚖 is parts-based if for words to be alike with respect to 𝚖 is for corresponding parts of those worlds to be intrinsically indiscernible.

# From Parts to Partitions

A parts-based subject matter induces an equivalence relation on "logical space". Worlds are equivalent if corresponding parts are intrinsically alike. A non-parts-based subject matter also induces an equivalence relation on logical space; worlds are equivalent just in case they are indiscernible where that subject matter is concerned.

If one wants a notion of subject matter that works
