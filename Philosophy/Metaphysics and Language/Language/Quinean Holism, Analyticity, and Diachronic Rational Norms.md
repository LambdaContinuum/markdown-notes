# Introduction

Quinean naturalists don't like the [[Kinds of Truths|analytic or the a priori]], one major reason for this conviction is those notions are incompatible with Quinean holism. This comes from Quine's "Two Dogmas of Empiricism", where he gives the following argument:

Given the truth of the [[The Duhem Thesis and the Quine Thesis|Duhem thesis]], according to which statements in our system of beliefs "face the tribunal of sense experience not individually but only as a corporate body", it turns out that, when contrary experience occasions a change in our system of beliefs, "there is much latitude of choice as to what statements to re-evaluate" on the basis of that experience, in which case

> it becomes folly to seek a boundary between synthetic statements, which hold contingently on experience, and analytic statements which hold come what may. Any statement can be held true come what may, if we make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the system. …Conversely, by the same token, no statement is immune to revision.

The argument should be familiar. The idea is that a sentence that's analytic, since it's true no matter what the world is like, is going to be one that we're required to accept no matter what we experience, and a sentence that's synthetic, since its truth value depends on what the world is like, is going to be one that we're required to reject in the light of certain courses of experience.

On the holistic picture, no sentence can have either status. So, given holism, no sentence is *either* analytic *or* synthetic. Call this the *argument from holism*.

A similar argument against the indefeasible a priori is available: Since, on holistic epistemology, there can be no class of sentences that have special epistemic status, there's no reason in principle to deny that we might be induced, in face of some bizarre course of experience, to give up even those beliefs that we currently take to be most secure, such as our beliefs in logical laws. Call this the *argument from universal susceptibility*. This argument ins't explicit in "Two Dogmas".

Anti-Quinean responses tend to proceed in one of two ways.
1. Reject holism. After all, the Quinean arguments rest squarely on Quine's holistic premises. Holism is already quite a radical doctrine, so this is an attractive strategy.
2. Point out that holism, true or not, does not itself entail Quine's conclusion: it's well know that the success of the Quinean arguments hinges also on antecedent doubt about the legitimacy of appeals to sentential meaning. After all, if it's granted that a sentence has a determinate meaning, then the fact that we can give that sentence up tells us neither that it isn't analytic nor that it isn't a priori, since we can give up even an analytic or a priori sentence as long as we change what the sentence means. Grice and Strawson press this point in their classic response to "Two Dogmas", explaining we can accept both analyticity and holism as long as we can appeal to "the distinction between that kind of giving up which consists in merely admitting falsity, and that kind of giving up which involves changing or dropping a [[Theory of Concepts|concept]] or set of concepts".

This isn't new to Quine. He addresses the notion of meaning in the first part of "Two Dogmas" and concludes that it can't really be made sense of. It's a member of a circle of supposedly obscure notions none of which can be understood except in terms of the others.

Grice and Strawson don't take Quine to have shown that the notion of meaning should be abandoned, but neither do they try to explain that notion in a way that Quine would find satisfactory. They're content to insist that Quine's standards are too strict, that the notion of meaning is, by reasonable standards, entirely unproblematic.

Even if the opponents of Quinean naturalism are right to take the notion of meaning to be unproblematic their mere insistence that this is the case isn't going to be persuasive to anyone who *shares* Quine's standards. By the same token, Quinean naturalists can't hope to convince their opponents that the notion of meaning is unintelligible by appeal to standards of intelligibility those opponents reject as too strict.

The result is a philosophical deadlock. This state of affairs is profoundly unsatisfying. This is where Chalmers comes in. His ambitious project in *Constructing the World* requires appeal to the a priori, and so, he tries to respond to Quine's arguments on grounds that Quinean naturalists can accept. He tries to show that anyone who endorse a certain kind of diachronic constraint on epistemic rationality, and Quinean naturalists do tend to endorse constraints of the relevant kind, is thereby committed both to the notion of meaning and to the existence of a priori truths. This strategy may give us a way to break the deadlock.

Sadly, it fails. Here it will be shown that if Quineans take language choice to itself be subject to rational norms then they can endorse the relevant diachronic epistemic constraints while rejecting both the notion of meaning and the existence of a priori truths.

What about the strategy of rejecting holism? That fails even harder. Holism is generally taken to be a radical doctrine. But it will be shown here that Quine's holistic premises have been widely misunderstood. Correctly interpreted, they aren't radical at all. In fact, these premises are quite minimal, so much so that rejecting them seems like a hopeless strategy.

The two tasks here are as follows: provide a novel interpretation of the Quinean arguments and showing that Chalmers's argument can't give Quineans reason to accept the notion of meaning or the existence of a priori truths.

We'll start with Quine's holism.

# Holism and Quinean Epistemology
---
Lets being by examining the two corollaries of Quine's holism from which it's supposed to follow that there are no determinately analytic sentences:

> [!box_name] Holding-True.
> Any statement can be held true come what may, if we make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the system.

> [!box_name] Revisability.
> Conversely, by the same token, no statement is immune to revision.

The usual way of interpreting them has them as epistemological claims about what a thinker can rationally believe in the face of various bodies of evidence.

Chalmers interprets Quine this way: on his view, the picture Quine is endorsing is one on which "any statement can be *rationally* held true come what may" and "no statement is immune to *rational* revision". Chalmers considers two different ways of reading that picture.

> a pragmatist reading…, stressing the freedom to adjust ancillary hypotheses as one chooses, \[and] an empiricist reading, stressing the role of unexpected evidence in driving us to revise our beliefs. Roughly, where the pragmatist reading turns on the claim that one may accept or reject certain statements, the empiricist reading turns on the claim that one should (or perhaps that one would).

On the pragmatic reading, Quine's view is that, for any sentence and any body of evidence, a thinker faced with that evidence is rationally permitted both to accept that sentence and to reject that sentence (not at the same time of course). 

On the empiricist reading, Quine's view is that, for any sentence, there's some body of evidence such that a thinker faced with that evidence is rationally required to reject that sentence.

On the empiricist reading, the conjunction of Holding-true and Revisability is incoherent: if every sentence is such that we're rationally required to reject it in the face of some body of evidence, then it certainly isn't the case that every sentence is such that we can rationally continue believing it come what may.

On the pragmatist reading, the argument from holism depends on an epistemological doctrine according to which, for any body of evidence, the set of systems of belief compatible with ideal rationality given that evidence is large enough that, for any sentence, the set contains at least one system on which the sentence is accepted and at least one system on which it's rejected. That means it's never the case, that given some body of evidence, any particular hypothesis is any better off than its alternatives. This is a radically permissive view.

Neither reading is acceptable., and these are the only readings available if we take Holding-true and Revisability to be claims about what can rationally be believed. How must we understand these claims?

We find our answer if we keep in mind that Quine takes his holistic doctrine to be equivalent to the Duhem thesis. This thesis is about *refutation*: it says that, since a given hypothesis has empirical consequences only when conjoined with a whole system of auxiliary hypotheses, it's impossible to use experimental contradiction to conclusively falsify any single hypothesis. In other words experimental results can never be *inconsistent*with a single hypothesis. Note this is fairly minimal claim about the relationship of deductive logic to scientific inquiry, not a radical claim about rationality. (After all, whether experimental results can *confirm* or *disconfirm* a single hypothesis is a question the thesis tells us nothing about.)

The Duhem thesis is thus not a thesis about rationality but about the logical structure of our system of beliefs. So if we take seriously Quine's claim about his doctrine is equivalent to that thesis, we're led to the conclusion that what Quine is committed to is primarily a logico-structural doctrine that there will always be many ways to revise a system of beliefs in order to maintain consistency with experience. Not an epistemic doctrine about what can rationally be believed.

Holding-true is just the claim that any sentence can *consistently* be held true come what may, and Revisability is just the claim that any sentence can *consistently* be given up in the face of any body of evidence.

For friends of sentential meaning, these statements are no threat to analyticity: all though any sentence can consistently be revised, an analytic sentence can't consistently be revised *without meaning change*, and although any sentence can consistently be held true come what may, a synthetic sentence can't consistently be held true come what may *without meaning change*.

In the context of Quine's argument from holism, we can't rely on this "without meaning change" clause. The argument isn't independent of the circularity argument in the first part of "Two Dogmas", and the upshot of that argument is that legitimacy of meaning and other intensional notions is in question.

What Quine is exploring is thus whether we can use the notion of revisability to make sense of these intensional notions. And in this context, the fact that we can make sense of analyticity if we already have the intensional notion of meaning change just isn't probative, what we need is a way of using revisability to make sense of analyticity *without* relying on other intensional notions. So the notion of meaning change is unavailable, which means we have the bare fact: any sentence can consistently be *either* held true come what may *or* revised in the face of evidence. 

And that's why analyticity is under threat: unless a notion of meaning change is already available, there's no way to use facts about revisability to distinguish analytic sentences from synthetic ones. The hope was immunity to revision change might allow us to characterize analyticity and so might help us break into our circle of poorly understood notions, but it turns out that it can't do so.

On this interpretation Quine is in a relatively strong dialectic position: given the truistic character of Holding-true and Revisability, trying to deny these holistic premises isn't a good strategy for resisting the argument from holism.  Friends of the analytic need to give Quineans reason to think there *is* a principled distinction to be drawn between cases in which meaning changes over time and case in which it remains constant. They need to show there's reason to reject Quine's skepticism about sentential meaning.

Note that nothing in this argument gives Quine the resources to mount anything like the argument from universal susceptibility.

What's needed then is some Quinean rationale for accepting the following principle:

> [!box_name] Defeasibility.
> For any thinker and any sentence, there's some body of evidence in the face of which that thinker can't rationally believe that science.

This stance isn't exhausted by the Duhem thesis, Quine is committed to the view that two systems, even if each of them is *consistent* with some body of evidence, need not be equally good responses to that evidence from the point of view of rationality.

He needs to explain on what basis one system is to be chosen over another. For Quine, that basis is given by certain [[Systematizing the theoretical virtues|theoretical desiderata]]: simplicity, familiarity (i.e., continuity with previous systems), predictive scope, and fecundity (i.e., ability to be extended to cover additional phenomena). Our goal, on Quine's view, is to adopt systems that on balance exhibit these properties to as great a degree as possible.

So these theoretical desiderata, according to Quine, can provide epistemic grounds for preferring one system of beliefs over another, even when both systems are consistent with a given body of evidence. And if that's right, then it's possible, given the set of all systems of belief consistent with a body of evidence, to use the desiderata to generate a partial ranking of systems and so to determine which ones are epistemically better than the rest. This fact is the basis of the Quinean case for Defeasibility.

What's crucial is that the desiderata are desiderata for whole systems, not for individual sentences. So no sentence is exempt from investigation: If, for some body of evidence, none of the systems of beliefs picked out as best by the desiderata include some sentence S, then S is to be given up in  the face of that evidence, even if S is a statement of a logical law. 

This suggests that every sentence is defeasible. For a sentence to be indefeasible, after all, it would need to be the case that, for any body of evidence whatsoever, at least one of the systems of beliefs picked out as best by the desiderata includes that sentence. And given the holistic character of the desiderata, there’s no reason to suppose that any sentence is special in this way. On these grounds Quinean naturalists tend to accept Defeasibility.

This case is less than conclusive: even if we have no principle reasoned to suppose that there are any indefeasible sentences, it doesn't follow that there definitely are none. Some S may happen to be such that, for any body of evidence whatsoever, each of the systems of beliefs picked out as best by Quine's desiderata includes S. In which case S is indefeasible.

One way to strengthen the case for Defeasibility, then, is to identify sentences that are prima facie plausible candidates for indefeasibility and then dream up bodies of evidence in the face of which thinkers would be rationally required to reject those sentences. This sort of consideration of individual cases can't conclusively establish defeasibility, any conclusive proof of that thesis would, for obvious reasons, be self-defeating, but it does provide additional reason to accept the principle.

The point is that Quineans seem to have good reason to accept Defeasibility, so friends of the a priori can break the deadlock here by showing Quinean naturalists there's reason to reject this principle.

# The Diachronic Rationality Arguments
---
Quine's opponents' best hope for responding to the argument from holism is to give Quinean naturalists reason to accept a notion of meaning change, and their best hope for responding to the argument from universal susceptibility is to give Quinean naturalists reason to reject Defeasibility.

Chalmers tries to do both by appeal to diachronic epistemic norms. His presentation is complicated by his reliance on a misinterpretation of the Quinean position: in taking the argument from holism to be an epistemic argument, he runs it together with the argument from universal susceptibility, and so he takes himself to be giving one response to a single argument rather than two separate responses to two distinct arguments.

Here we'll tease apart the considerations relevant to the argument from holism from those relevant to the argument universal susceptibility, and reconstruct Chalmers's arguments based on what is taken to be essential in his discussion.

First some preliminaries. The diachronic norm Chalmers chooses to work with is a sentential version of the Bayesian conditionalization principle: $cr_2(S)$ and $cr_1(S \mid E)$ should be equal, where $cr_1(*)$ specifies a thinker's credal state at $t_1$, $cr_2(*)$ specifies a thinker's credal state at $t_2$, $S$ is any sentence, and $E$ is an evidence sentence specifying the total evidence acquired between $t_1$ and $t_2$.

The use of a probabilistic framework isn't important, Chalmers could run his argument with any epistemic norm that requires there to be a match between one's beliefs on supposing one has acquired a particular body of evidence, and one's later beliefs on actually acquiring that evidence.

What is important is that the norm is stated in terms of sentences rather than propositions, since Chalmers's point is to show that anyone who accepts diachronic norms of the relevant sort is thereby committed to contested intensional notions (primarily meaning and meaning change, but derivatively synonymy, proposition, etc.), it wouldn't do to appeal directly to any such notion at the outset.

The use sentences though seems prima facie like it could complicate Chalmers's treatment of evidence; his appeal to evidence sentences to specify the evidence acquired b thinkers raises questions about whether he's illegitimately presupposing that the correspondence between those sentences and the bodies of evidence they specify is guaranteed to remain constant over time. This doesn't seem like a problem though:

> Learning E does not typically involve the sentence E at all. …So there is no use of E at $t_2$ that needs to be aligned with the use of E at $t_1$. At best we need to require that E as used at $t_1$ correctly applies to the evidence acquired at $t_2$.

The point is that, at $t_2$, the evidence sentence is irrelevant. The point of the conditionalization constraint is just to ensure that thinkers' initial conditional beliefs on supposing that they have particular evidence match their later beliefs on accepting that they have the very same evidence, so our conditionalization principle is going to be available as long as we have a grip on what it is for a subject to accept or suppose that certain evidence obtains.

Basically, if appeals to thinkers' abilities to accept and suppose they have particular bodies of evidence are legitimate, there's no problem with stating our conditionalization principle in terms of evidence sentences.

And such appeals are legitimate in the present context, Quineans will allow that we can make sense of the relevant notions here, after all, revising one's beliefs in the face of evidence involves accepting that one has obtained that evidence, and experimental design is science requires thinkers to reason suppositionally about the different ways in which various bodies of evidence would induce them to revise their beliefs.

On to the arguments themselves. First is the argument for analyticity, whose critical premise is that the sentential conditionalization principle, as stated, isn't exceptionless. According to Chalmers, a thinker can count as epistemically rational even if $cr_2(S) \neq cr_1(S \mid E)$ since it remains possible that the thinkers credences in relevant propositions obey conditionalizations, but that his credences in associated sentences do not, because the association between sentences and propositions changes over time.

So a thinker who violates sentential conditionlization isn't necessarily guilty of any epistemic transgression, after all, there are cases where S is associated with an entirely different proposition at $t_2$ than it is at $t_1$, and in such cases, it's hard to see why one's attitude toward S at $t_2$ should be constrained by one's attitude toward S at $t_1$.

Now it would be unsurprising if this sort of change in association could occur in cases where S contained an indexical expression. But according to Chalmers, it can occur even in cases where S is eternal. In these cases, the change in association can be due only to a shift in S's *meaning*, So Quineans, in order to account for cases of this sort, must allow that some notion of meaning is intelligible.

Quineans would take issue with Chalmers's description since it appeals to proposition, but that appeal isn't essential. What's important is just the idea itself:

There might be cases in which violations of sentential conditionalizations are epistemically rational even when the relevant sentences are eternal. If such cases are possible, Quineans need to explain how, and the only available explanation is that the meanings of the relevant sentences can change over time.  Meaning Quineans are committed to a notion of meaning that can play a role is epistemological explanation.

Consider, Chalmers's case in which a thinker, Fred, has a high $cr_1(B)$, where $B$ is the sentence "All bachelors are untidy," and then, between $t_1$ and $t_2$, acquires evidence of the existence of a 25-year old man who's both unmarried and tidy, specified by the evidence sentence $E$. Rather than giving up his belief in $B$, Fred denies that the mean is really a bachelor, claiming that only men over 30 count as bachelors. So his $cr_2(B)$, like his $cr_1(B)$, is high. Suppose, though, that Fred, at $t_1$, counted *all* unmarried men as bachelors and so had a low conditional credence $cr_1(B\mid E)$. Then he has violated sentential conditionalization, but we can suppose, that he is nevertheless fully epistemically rational. The only way for Fred to be rational here is for the meaning of $B$ to have changed.

We then have a sufficient condition for meaning change: If, for some fully epistemic rational thinker and some eternal sentence $S$, $cr_2(S) \neq cr_1(S \mid E)$, where $E$ specifies the total evidence acquired between $t_1$ and $t_2$, then the meaning of $S$ has changed between $t_1$ and $t_2$.

This isn't a necessary condition for meaning change. It may be that the thinker's credence happen to satisfy sentential conditionalization even though the meaning of $S$ has changed. But that's not a problem. Chalmers's goal isn't to define the notion of meaning. It's just to show that we *need* the notion of meaning in order to explain what's going on in cases in which the sufficient condition is met, as long as there are indeed such cases the diachronic rationality argument for analyticity can do its work.

So, if there can be epistemically rational violations of sentential conditionalization for eternal sentences, then Quinean naturalists are committed to a notion of meaning that can play a role in epistemic explanation. In that case, naturalists must concede that analyticity is at least intelligible, since it can be defined in terms of such a notion.

Now for the argument for apriority, observe the following: If some sentence S is such that the only way for a thinker to give it up is by violating sentential conditionalization then S is exempt from defeat by evidence, which means that we have a counter-example to Defeasibility. It follows that Quinean naturalists, if they want to maintain Defeasibility and so to deny that there are any a priori truths, must insist that there's no such S. That is, they must insist that, if a thinker is rational, then for any sentence S, there's some evidence E such that thinkers's $cr(S \mid E)$ is low.

The question is whether this claim is one Quinean naturalists can legitimately insist on. Chalmers thinks not, he gives a formal argument intended to show, on Bayesian grounds, that it ought to be rejected. Lets set that aside for a moment. What's important for now is just that Quineans, if they want to maintain their view, cannot reject the claim; if they did, they'd be forced to concede that there are a priori truths.

The diachronic rationality arguments can show at least the following:
1. That if there can be epistemically rational violations of sentential conditionalization for eternal sentences, then the notion of analyticity is intelligible;
2. That if there are sentences that can't rationally be given up except by violating sentential conditionalization, then there are a priori sentences.

It's necessary to work out what the Quinean naturalist should say about the antecedent of those two conditionals.

# Rational Violations of Sentential Conditionalization?
---
To Chalmers, the claim that it's possible for an epistemically rational thinker to violate sentential conditionalization in cases with eternal sentences, is clearly true; there's "a constitutive link between rational inference and conceptual constancy" such that diachronic norms like sentential conditionalization are subject to obvious exceptions that can only be accounted for by appeal to meaning change.

However, there's a reasonable conception of the relationship between rationality and language, that the Quinean should leans towards on independent grounds, on which the claim is false: our sentential conditionalization principle is *not* subject to exceptions in the relevant case. And so the argument fails.

First, we'll assume for the sake of argument that sentences do have meanings and that these meanings can change over time. Then taking that assumption as given, I argue that, there are rational norms governing whether and how meaning is to be changed in the face of evidence. I then show that, if there are norms of this kind, then on a reasonable view that Quinean should accept, these norms must be taken into account even when a thinker is merely reasoning suppositionally about how to respond to a particular body of evidence. If that's right, then meaning change, when it's rational, is going to be reflected in a thinker's conditional credences, which means that it's not going to be the source of exceptions to our sentential conditionalization principle. Finally, I explain why this allows Quineans to maintain their skepticism about sentential meaning despite the fact we appealed to sentential meaning in order to arrive it.

Consider again the case of Fred, who continues to have a high credence in B after acquiring evidence specified by E, despite the fact that his $cr_1(B \mid E)$ was low. If we take as given the assumption that sentences do indeed have meanings, and what meaning a sentence has can change over time, we can suppose that B has undergone such a shift. It expresses one proposition before the evidence is acquired and a different on afterward. The question now is whether this sort of meaning change is in any way rationally constrained. That is, does Fred have the right to make sentences such a B mean whatever he likes, or can he be faulted for choices he makes about the meanings of expressions of his language?

If we assume Fred can't be faulted for their choice about meanings of expressions, we can conclude this case is indeed an exception to our sentential conditionalization principle: since Fred can rationally change the meaning of B in whatever way he likes between $t_1$ and $t_2$, he can be ideally rational despite that fact that $cr_2(B) \neq cr_1(B \mid E)$.

This is false, whether we regard B as a sentence of a communal language or as a sentence of Fred's idiolect.

False in the former case because if the language is communal, then Fred presumably must do his best to use B was those in his linguistic community use it, which means that whether he's rational to have B mean something different than it did before depends on what evidence he has about its use among other members of his community. (Technically this description of the situation isn't really apt, Strictly speaking if the language is communal then it's not [[The Solution and the 'Private Language' Argument|even possible for Fred to have B mean what he likes]].)

In the latter case, where B is a sentence of Fred's idiolect, it's plausible that there are constraints on what sorts of changes in meaning are permissible. If Fred holds on to B because he has arbitrarily changed its meaning so that it comes to express some radically different propositions, such as the proposition $1 + 1 = 2$, then surely he's made *some* sort of mistake. (This is an intuitive judgement, but its possible to give a Quinean rationale for this claim. A thinker who arbitrarily changes the meaning of an expression will need to adjust her attitudes toward various sentences as a result, this sort of arbitrary judgement can be ruled out due to familiarity desideratum.) If that's right, then there are rational norms governing meaning change.

To anticipate an objection: One might say that the norms governing meaning change are norms of practical rationality and are irrelevant to the present context. What we're concerned with are epistemic rational norms governing meaning change.

This objection fails. There isn't a bright line between practical and epistemic rationality, for Quinean naturalists, for that presumes that epistemic pragmatism is false, but Quine is an epistemic pragmatist. His view is that the grounds for choosing among systems of belief are given by the practical desiderata. Much of his point in arguing against the analytic-synthetic distinction is to show, *contra* Carnap, that matters of fact can't in principle be disentangled from one's choice of language, which means he has to deny that factual questions and questions about what language to use are to be answered on different grounds. Since questions abut what language to use are answered on pragmatic grounds, he has to insist that the epistemic grounds on which factual questions are to be answered can't in principle be disentangled from pragmatic ones. Consider the ending of "Two Dogmas"

> Carnap, Lewis, and others take a pragmatic stand on the question of choosing between language forms, scientific frameworks; but their pragmatism leaves off at the imagined boundary between the analytic and the synthetic. In repudiating such a boundary I espouse a more thorough pragmatism. Each man is given a scientific heritage plus a continuing barrage of sensory stimulation; and the considerations which guide him in warping his scientific heritage to fit his continuing sensory promptings are, where rational, pragmatic.

The Quinean view is that epistemology itself is shot through with practical considerations, and there's a deep connection between that fact and the non-existence of a principled analytic-synthetic distinction. So the objection under discussion which relies on the assumption that epistemological pragmatism is false, begs one of the central questions at issue here and so isn't compelling in the present context. Remember the goal here is to give Quineans themselves reason to abandon their views, and their opponents can't hope to do that by appealing to assumptions they reject.

If meaning change  is rationally constrained, then given a thinker's body of evidence, there are facts of the matter about what the expressions of that thinker's language ought to mean.

If there are facts of the matter about what thinker's sentence S ought to mean in a given situation, then those facts play a role in determining how confident the thinker should be in S. The credence the thinker ought to have in S can be expressed as a function of two things: what proposition S ought to express and what credence the thinkers should have in that proposition.

This can be represented formally. Suppose for a thinkers's sentence $S$, there are $n$ propositions $p_1, ..., p_n$ that are candidates for being expressed by $S$, and let $exp(S, p, E)$ be the following function: $$exp(S, p, E) = \begin{cases}1, \text{ if S on the evidence E ought express p}\\
0, \text{ otherwise.}\end{cases}$$
Let $cr(*)$ specify the thinker's credal state at time $t$, ant let $E_t$ be an evidence sentence specifying the total evidence the thinker has at $t$. If the thinker is fully rational, $cr(*)$ satisfies the following constraint: $$cr(S) = \sum_{i = 1}^n exp(S, p_i, E_i) \times cr(p_i)$$
Call this constraint 1. The degree of belief a thinker should have in a sentence S is equal to the degree of belief she should have in the proposition that ought to be expressed by S. (Few assumptions are made to make the presentation earlier, if I want more details I'll come back).

Look I don't really buy any of this.
