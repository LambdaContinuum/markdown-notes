# The emergence of vagueness
---
Only two traditions in the history of philosophy have found serious problem in sorites paradoxes. One culminated in stoicism; the other is modern analytic philospohy.

This is because of the centrality of formal logic in both traditions. Analytic philosophy treats sorties paradoxes under the heading of 'vagueness'.

Three philosophers in the analytic tradition will be discussed. For Frege, a logical calculus is a powerful but delicate engine which cannot tolerate grit. Blurred boundaries make one form of grit.

Unlike Frege, Peirce and Russell produced theories of vagueness. Pierce often seems to talk about something quite different, but his usage reflects the inchoate ordinary sense of the term. Russell helped make the technical sense canonical, although his theory fails to demarcate vagueness according to his intentions.

# Frege
---
Frege constructs his formal language in 1879. Such a language was artificial. This is not merely to point out that it was deliberately constructed. It's to assign his syntactic and semantic rule-making a different status from that possessed by the activity of a grammarian for a natural language.

Frege's definitions are stipulative; unlike dictionary definitions they do not describe an independently existing practice. What it is for a symbol in an artificial language to mean something is for it to be stipulated to have that meaning. It follows that if no meaning is stipulated, the symbol has no meaning.

Any defect in a stipulative definition automatically makes the defined term defective in meaning. Frege held that many definitions in the foundations of math were defective, often because they made no stipulations for certain cases.

The possibilities for defects of definition gave him a way of thinking about semantically defective expressions in natural languages too. Thus a vague term such as 'heap' may be thought of as incompletely defined, because in borderline cases it is neither stipulated to apply nor stipulated not to apply. Of course expressions of natural language do not have their meanings by stipulation, but our use of them may be thought of as having the effect of stipulation. Frege tends to lump vagueness with incompleteness of definition.

The Stoics' epistemic solution would be of no use to Frege.

Frege's remarks on vagueness must be seen in the light of his conception of a logically perfect language. What must a language be like to permit the rigorous conduct of mathematical reasoning? Symbols can be combined in arbitrarily complex formulas, so the language will contain infinitely many possible sentences. So you cannot demarcate well-formed formulas and assign them meaning by listing them.

One will stipulate recursive rules. The semantic will assign the well-formed expressions meaning in a parallel way. For a rigorous system of logic to be formulated, syntax and semantic must somehow correspond. Rigor demands that a rule of inference be specified in purely syntactic terms, so that adherence to it can be mechanically checked. A rule of inference must also be valid: it must preserve truth from premises to conclusion.

The contribution of an expression to making arguments valid or invalid by making sentences in which it occurs true or false is its referent. The truth-value of a sentence is worked out recursively as a function of the referents of its constituents expressions. In a logically perfect language, every well-formed expression has one and only one referent, invariant from context to context, for any variation would constitute a semantic difference not manifested in any syntactic difference, and might therefore invalidate rules of inference formulated in purely syntactic terms.

A sentence is formed form a name and a predicate in the simplest case: '7 is a prime' as an example. The sentence is true because the object named by '7' falls under the concept predicated by 'is prime'. The referent of the name '7' is simply the number 7. Frege takes the referent of a name to be its bearer. The role of the predicate 'is prime' is to divide objects into two classes, the primes and the rest; '7 is prime' is true because 7 falls in the former class. '8 is prime' false because 8 falls in the latter.

Thus Frege takes the referent of a predicate to be a function associating each object with a truth-value, truth or falsity. The truth-value of the sentence is the result of applying the referent of the predicate, a function, to the referent of the name, an object. So, the referent of 'is prime' is a function that maps each prime to truth and each non-prime to falsity.

Any function mapping objects to truth-values is a *concept* in Frege's technical sense. An object falls under a concept if and only if the concept maps the object to truth.

Frege also contrasts the referent of an expression with its sense. Since the referent is what the sense presents, sense determines reference. Since the referent of a complex expression is presented as a function of the presented referents of the component expressions, the sense of the former is composed of the senses of the latter.

How does vagueness fit into this framework? To define a concept, one must lay down a rule mapping each object to a truth-value. In attempting to do so, one might forget to stipulate for certain cases. For example, suppose that one stipulates that all positive integers be mapped to truth and all negative ones to falsity, but makes no stipulations for zero. One has failed to specify the concept. The conditions specified have been met both by a concept mapping zero to truth and by one mapping it to falsity. And so no one concept has been singled out.

It would be wrong to say that one has specified a partial concept, a concept undefined for some objects. To do that, one would need to stipulate that the concept be undefined for zero, but one has not got even that far. Failing to stipulate a value is not to stipulate that there be no value.

Mathematicians sometimes define a function to be 'undefined' in certain cases; this is quite different from not making a stipulation for those cases. This practice is coherent by Fregean lights only if one thinks of undefined as another value that a function can take. There is nothing indeterminate about such cases.

Frege denies the existence of partial functions which leave some objects unmapped to anything. Thus there are no partial concepts. In more familiar terms, there are no vague concepts. If concepts are analogized to areas on a plane, a vague concept would be an area without sharp boundary lines, gradually shading off into the background and that according to Frege would be no area at all.

The crucial part here is that if our attempt to define a predicate is incomplete, it has not been assigned any one concept. It lacks a referent. Since vagueness is treated as incompleteness of definition, vague predicates have no referent.

What happens if one introduces a vague predicate into Frege's formula language? The truth-value of a sentence is a function of the referents of its constituents. But a function cannot deliver a value until its applied to something. Since a vague predicate lacks a referent, it provides nothing to which the function can be applied. Thus the function does not deliver a value. Sentences containing vague predicates don't have truth-values then, so no sentence containing it is true.

So if predicate-involving formulas are to be recognizable as logically valid by their syntactic structure, all predicates in the language must be everywhere defined. On Frege's view, this entails a bad on vague predicates. Frege treats sorites paradoxes as another symptom of what goes wrong when vague predicates are admitted into the language.

Frege sometimes speaks of sorites paradoxes as the result of treating a vague predicate as though it stood for a sharp concept. This isn't quite right, someone who does think that 'heap' stands for a concept with a sharp cut-off point should not agree that one bean never makes the difference between a heap and non-heap. The paradox arises because we do try to acknowledge the vagueness of 'heap', but then find our concession leads to absurdities. If we make this concession to vagueness, we cannot expect to get away with use of rigorous logic, which is designed only for referring and therefore precise expressions.

This account of vagueness is wholly negative. Yet Frege can't deny that vague languages serve us perfectly well for ordinary purpose. We use it to communicate information all the time. Some explanation is needed of our success, given vague expressions fail to refer. Frege makes some gesture in this direction. Michael Dummett argues that they should not be taken seriously, since Frege holds that vagueness and other failures of definition are 'defects because no fully coherent account of language exhibiting such features is possible. If a coherent theory of vague expressions could be constructed, vagueness would not be a defect'.

Dummett has overstates his case. No correct account can be given of the referents of vague expressions, because they have none. Vagueness has no logic, for logical laws are to be formulated in a language in which there is no reference failure. So much is Fregean. But Frege lumps vagueness together with ambiguity and partiality, of which coherent accounts surely can be given. If a mathematician uses the name '7' ambiguously for two different objects, one can coherently say what they are. Bad definition imposes too many or too few constraints on the reference of the expression to be defined, but the constraints themselves can be stated.  His position does not rule out the possibility of a coherent account of vague expressions.

What cannot be expected is a coherent Fregean theory that matches a vague expression of the language being theorized about with a synonymous expression of the language in which the theorizing is being done, for the latter expression would then have to be vague too, and therefore fail to refer. A coherent Fregean account of a vague language must be formulated in a perfectly precise language. The difficulty of this task is evident; Frege did not claim to have come close to meeting it.

Frege once suggested that ordinary language succeeds as a medium of communication because the senses of its sentences are not determined by the senses of their constituent words unlike a logically perfect language. Thus I can use a sentence made up of vague words to get across to you a thought with a truth-value, even though my words individually fail to refer.

Logic require expressions have the same referents wherever they occur; vague natural languages violate this constraint. There is no question of locating a specific principle of logic that fails in vague languages, for just about any principle fails when words change their meaning from occurrence to occurrence. Frege's account is quite implausible. It treats vague sentences like idioms. Most utterances aren't understood as idiom, as Frege himself points out in other connections. Frege wouldn't care about the failure of his explanation, not because he thought it had to fail, but because it's not a cartographer's job to explain why travelers with bad maps or none at all sometimes reach their destinations.

# Peirce
---
Both Frege and Peirce subscribe to the view that successful inquiry involves a movement from vagueness towards precision. They differed in this: for Frege, vagueness is to be eliminated at the beginning of inquiry; for Peirce, it is not eliminated before its end.

On Frege's view we cannot reason reliably until we have precise language. On Peirce's, our language will always be vague. Vagueness is harmful only when it leaves the question at hand too unclear to be answered. We cannot hope to ever achieve perfect clarity in all respects, but we can hope to clarify the question in relevant respects until it can be answered.

Peirce gave a sustained discussion of vagueness. Vagueness figures as a characteristic of the indubitable tenets of common sense with which inquiry begins, a precondition of their certainty.

For example, that fire burns is certain but only because it's vague. The belief is not falsified when fire fails to burn a stone, for it does not specify precisely what fire burns in what circumstances.

The certainty of vague beliefs lie in their unspecificity. There are different ways of lacking specificity. If I believe you are between  11m and 9,437 mm in height, such a belief is unspecific because a wide range of heights would make it clearly true. If I believe that you are of average height, my belief is unspecific because a wide range of heights would make it neither clearly true nor clearly false, even though only a narrow range would make it clearly true.

The former belief draws a sharp line around a wide area; the latter draws a blurred line around a small one. Of the two, most contemporary philosophers would classify only the belief that you are of average height as particularly vague. Vagueness is a matter of blurred boundaries. Peirce, in contrast, counts both beliefs as vague, for he regarded all unspecificity as a kind of vagueness.

On this view, to be vague is to leave a wide range of cases not clearly excluded. Peirce's wide use of 'vague' distances him from alter work on vagueness. Vagueness is contrasted with generality and determinacy. 'Man is mortal' is general; it requires that every man be mortal. 'This month a great event is to happen' is vague; it requires only that some great event happens this month, without specifying what. Both vague and general sentences are indeterminate in the sense that their grammatical subjects are not perfectly specific; there are many possible men and many possible great events

A sign is said to be vague when its further determination depends on the utterer, general when it depends on the interpreter.

# Russell
---
Russell made the distinction between vagueness and unspecificity; his theorizing unmade it again.

Vagueness appears as a natural phenomenon, one of the primitive ways in which representations diverge from what they represent. It makes a logically perfect language physically impossible. It consists in 10 theses.

1. Only representations are vague.

Russell insists that vagueness and precision are properties only of symbols in relation to what they represent. Were there no representation, there would be no vagueness. But the attribution to the world at large of properties of language is the occupational hazard of metaphysics.

In confining vagueness to representations, Russell does not confine it to language. He allows thoughts and images as private representations. Not even all public representations are linguistic. A things appearance is a public representation of it, and therefore potentially vague. He holds that 'all vagueness in language and thought is essentially analogous to this vagueness which may exist in a photograph'

2. All language is vague.

Russell next tries to argue that vagueness infects all words. He does so by choosing examples for which it is plausible that, if any words were precise, some of them would be, and argues that none of them are precise.

'Second' is the kind of word that science has tried its hardest to make precise, but without perfect success. When Russell wrote, the second was defined by reference to the rotation of the earth; earth is not a rigid body and different parts of its surface rotate in different periods, the definition does not single out an exact length of time.

Proper names are vague as well. 'Ebenezer Wilkes Smith' may be correctly applied to only one person, but it's vague in the temporal boundaries of its application, for birth and death are not absolutely instantaneous. It is agreed that it should name a person, but out concept 'person' is itself vague, being compatible with different standards for defining the beginning and end of existence.

The words with the best chance of avoiding vagueness are logical connectives. Russell begins with the words 'true' and 'false'. He argues that the vagueness of judgements to which they are applied induces a corresponding vagueness in 'true' and 'false'. If 'this is a man' is vague, so is '"this is a man" is true'. The meaning of a logical connective is given in terms of the concepts of truth and falsity. Thus the vagueness of 'true' and 'false' infects the logical connectives with vagueness too. All words are vague. Russell concludes that all language is vague.

Russell's argument neglects the relation between the vagueness of words and the vagueness of complex expressions. For example, the noun phrase 'enormous and tiny heap' is made up of vague words, it is not itself vague in the same way, for it has no borderline cases; it's just a contradiction in terms. So even if all words can have borderline cases, not all complex expressions can.

Maybe Russell would have been willing to define a complex expression as vague if and only if at least one of its simple constituents was vague. This has problems.

The deep problem here is that, on Russell's account, a word is vague just in case it can have a borderline case in which its application is essentially doubtful. What is essentially doubtful is a judgement, whose proper linguistic expression is in a sentence rather than a word. It is essentially doubtful whether *this is red*. A demonstrative and copula must be added to 'red' to form a suitable sentence. The primary application of 'vague' is to sentences, not to words. But the vagueness of a sentence does not imply the vagueness of every constituent word. One vague word is enough. For example, 'This is a red shape' is essentially doubtful because its essentially doubtful whether the shape is red, but it does not imply the vagueness of 'this is a shape'.

So how can the vagueness of 'This is red' show 'red' to be vague, unless 'this' is assumed to be precise? Russell's claim, that all words are vague, contradicts the assumption which he seems to need in arguing for that claim. How can he then show all words are vague?

How do these considerations affect Russell's argument for the vagueness of logical words? Suppose that '"This is a man" is true' expresses an essentially doubtful judgement in a given context; can the vagueness of 'true' be blamed? Russell seems to have undermined his positive answer by deriving the vagueness of '"This is a man" is true' from that of 'This is a man'. The subject rather than the predicate is to blame for its vagueness. it's of note that 'This is a man' occurs in '"This is a man" is true' only as part of a quotation. What matters is whether the quotation "This is a man" is vague, not whether the sentence is vague. This is a delicate issue. We can think of the quotation as like a name of an English sentence. As such, it is relevantly clear which English sentence it is a name of. A name of a vague sentence need not itself be vague. On this view, the vagueness of '"This is a man" is true' is to be blamed on the vagueness of 'true'. On the other hand, we can think of the quotation as a name for a precise proposition. It's reference will then be indeterminate between various precise propositions, so the quotation will be relevantly vague. On this view, the vagueness of '"This is a man" is true' is not blamed on the vagueness of 'true'. If 'true' is applied to vague sentences, it is vague; if it applied to precise propositions, it is precise. Russell claimed that 'true' and 'false' can have precise meanings only when they are applied to precise representations; the analysis confirms his claim.

What's more dubious is Russell's claim that vagueness infects all logical worlds. It's clear in a given context whether 'P' and 'Q' separately are true, it will also be clear whether 'P or Q' is true. The disjunction expresses an essentially doubtful judgement only when at least one of its disjuncts does. Since 'or' itself is not to blame, it has not been shown to be vague. Russell as best makes it plausible that most words have blurred boundaries. 

3. There is higher-order vagueness.
