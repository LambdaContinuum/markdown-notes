A common view of the private language argument in *Philosophical Investigations* assumes that it begins with section 243, and that it continues in the sections immediately following. This view takes the argument to deal primarily with a problem about sensation language. Further discussions traditionally emphasize such questions as whether the argument invokes a form of the verification principle, whether the form in question is justified, whether it is applied correctly to sensation language, whether the argument rests on exaggerated skepticism about memory, and so on.

Kripke thinks the real private language argument is to be found in the sections preceding 243 and that in section 202 the conclusion is already stated explicitly: "Hence it is not possible to obey a rule 'privately' otherwise thinking one was obeying a rule would be the same thing as obeying it."

The private language argument as applied to sensations is only a special case of much more general considerations about language previously argued; sensations have a crucial role as a convincing counterexample to the general considerations previously states. Wittgenstein therefore goes over the ground again in this special case, marshaling new specific considerations appropriate to it.

The basic structure of Wittgenstein's approach can be presented briefly as follows: A certain problem, or in Humean terminology, a "skeptical paradox", is presented concerning the notion of a rule. Following this, what Hume would have called a "skeptical solution" to the problem is presented.

There are two areas in which the force, both of the [[The Wittgensteinian Paradox|paradox]] and of its [[The Solution and the 'Private Language' Argument|solution]], are most likely to be ignored. One such area is the notion of a mathematical rule, such as the rule for addition. The other is our talk of our own inner experience, of sensations and other inner states. In treating both these cases, we should bear in mind the basic considerations about rules and language.

Kripke will attempt to present the set of problems and arguments which he personally got out of reading Wittgenstein. He isn't trying to present views of his own outside of a few exceptions, and he isn't trying to endorse or criticize Wittgenstein's approach.

It should be thought of as expounding neither "Wittgenstein's" argument nor "Kripke's": rather Wittgenstein's argument as it struck Kripke, as it presented a problem for him.
