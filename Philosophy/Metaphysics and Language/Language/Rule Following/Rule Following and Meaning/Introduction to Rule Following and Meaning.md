One of the most discussed books in recent philosophy is Kripke's [[Introduction to Kripke's Wittgenstein On Rules and Private Langauge|Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language]]. 

In it, Kripke's Wittgenstein's skeptic argues for a "skeptical paradox" about meaning: [[The Wittgensteinian Paradox|there is no fact of the matter]] in virtue of which an ascription of meaning, such as "Jones means addition by '+'", is true or false; and so, since nothing turns on the nature of Jones or of the '+' sign in particular, there is no fact of the matter as to whether any speaker means one thing rather than another.

KW attempts to neutralize the impact of the argument. Even though there are no facts in virtue of which ascriptions of meaning are true or false, the conclusion that all language is meaningless can be avoided via KW's "skeptical solution":

Ascriptions of meaning can be viewed as possessing some non fact-stating role, so the propriety of ascribing meanings to linguistic expressions isn't threatened by the argument.

The upshot is that the skeptical solution is available only for languages spoken by linguistic *communities*. A corollary of KW's neutralization of the skeptical paradox is thus that there can be no such thing as "solitary" language.

# The Skeptical Paradox
---
The general strategy adopted in arguing for the conclusion is as follows.

1. It is argued that if the species of fact in question is to be found, then it must be found within some set of particular areas.
2. Once this has been done, our knowledge-acquiring powers are imagined to be idealized with respect to those areas: we're given *unlimited epistemic access* to the areas in question.
3. Once (2) is given, and the ensuring argument that even under these conditions the sought after meaning-facts still elude our grasp, and any particular claim about the character of these meaning-facts still cannot be justified, it follows that there simply were *no* such facts there in the first place. Since if there were any such facts, given unlimited epistemic access we would surely have found them

Let's take Kripke's example. Suppose you've never computed "68 + 57" in the past. After computing you obtain "125" as he answer. After checking you're work you're confident that "125" is the correct answer in two senses. The *arithmetical sense*, since 125 as a matter of arithmetical fact is the sum of 68 and 57; and it's correct in the *metalinguistic sense*, since the "+" sign really does mean the addition function. (You can imagine how these two senses of correctness might come apart: if the '+' sign really stood for the subtraction function, 125 would still be the sum, but the correct answer to the question "68 + 57 = ?" would be "11).

A bizarre skeptic comes and asks you to cite some fact about yourself which constitutes your meaning *addition* rather than *quaddition*. Any response to this challenge must satisfy [[Rule Following - SEP#The Extensionality Condition|two conditions]].

1. It has to provide us with an account of the type of fact that is constitutive of meaning of "+".
2. It has to be possible to *read off* from this fact what constitutes *correct* and *incorrect* use of the "+" sign. It must show why the answer to the problem "68 + 57 = ?" is *justified*.

In accordance with the general strategy outlined above, KW's skeptic begins his argument that this challenge cannot be met by allowing us unlimited epistemic access to two areas, and inviting us to find a suitable meaning-constituting fact from within either of these two areas. The areas in question are
1. Our previous behavior, linguistic and non-linguistic.
2. The entire contents of our previous mental histories.

Nothing from the finite pool of previous behavior will do since ex hypothesi I have never dealt with numbers larger than 57, and "plus" and "quus" have the same extensions for numbers smaller than 57.

A deviant interpretation of "+" always exists so you cannot enlarge the pool of previous deviant behavior.

Citing something like a *general thought* or *instruction* won't work because the skeptic can always respond by giving a deviant interpretation of the symbols of the general thought or instruction itself. The point can be generalized: 

Any set of instructions that come before the mind require interpretation as much as the linguistic expression whose understanding they are supposed to facilitate, and are thus as susceptible to deviant interpretations as that original expression. Invoking instructions for interpreting the instructions will send us off on a fruitless infinite regress.

Well what about the possession of some *mental image*. or some other specific mental item possessed of its own distinctive qualitative character? It seems not.
1. It's not a *necessary* condition for understanding that some particular item comes before one's mind when one hears or uses a given expression.
2. It's not a *sufficient* condition for meaning a sign in a particular way that some item, be it picture or otherwise, come before one's mind. The picture does not by itself determine the correct use of the associated word, because the picture thus associated is really just another sign whose meaning too requires to be fixed. There is no logical route from the properties of an image to the meaning of an associated word, because of the possibility of deviant applications of the word consistent with some interpretation of the picture. Whatever comes before the mind can be made to accord with a deviant application of the expression. Thus, mental images set no standard for the correct use of an expression.

Well maybe we're concentrating too exclusively on "quotidian" states of mind - states such as mental images, sensations, headaches, and other introspectible mental states with their own distinctive phenomenological character. Perhaps meaning addition is not a state of these kind but rather an irreducible state, a state of a unique kind of its own. They are *sui generis*.

This response is castigated by KW on the grounds that it is desperate and leaves completely mysterious the character of the primitive state thought to constitute understanding.
1. it is not an introspectible state and yet its possessor is though to be aware of it with a degree of certainty whenever he has it. How is this possible?
2. It's completely mysterious how "a finite object contained in our finite minds" could be such as to reach out to an indefinitely large number of future uses of an expression and determine whether or not they are correct in the light of that expression's meaning.
3. It's a mystery what the relationship is between these future uses and the putative primitive states; the response as it stands gives no clue as to what the nature of this relationship is, or how it is forged.

Maybe limiting ourselves to *past* actual behavior and previous *occurent* mental has guaranteed the success of KW's skeptic. We should consider *dispositional* facts about language users

The claim I meant *addition* would be true if I was disposed in the past, when asked to compute "x + y", to produce the *sum* of the two numbers. Thus, if my knowledge-acquiring powers concerning my dispositional properties sufficiently idealized, I would no doubt see I was disposed to give the answer "125" to the query.

KW's skeptic has two objections to the dispositional account.
1. It fails to take account of the *normativity* of meaning. We say a competent language speaker *ought* given his previous meanings and intentions to remain faithful to them, to respond to arithmetical questions in certain determine ways, and we believe the response he ought to give is logically independent of the response that he did give, or *would have given*, had he actually been faced with the query. But the dispositionalist account leaves no room for such a distinction between the answer he ought to have given and the answer he would have given. The dispositionalist account equates [[Chomsky and Wittgenstein on Linguistic Competence|*competence* and *performance*.]] The problem is even worse if we want the possibility that someone is *systematically mistaken*, in the sense that he is disposed to make mistakes. We want to leave room for the possibility that a person means addition but is giving answers out of line with those he ought to give. 
2. Dispositions, like the totality of our previous linguistic behavior, is finite. It's not true that I'm disposed in such a way that I'll always give the sum of two numbers when faced with "What is x + y?"; some numerals will simply be too long for me to handle and some will be so long that I'll die before having an opportunity to respond to the query. It's easy for KW's skeptic to construct deviant interpretations that are compatible with all of the dispositional facts concerning me. Perhaps I meant skaddition, where skaddition gives the results of addition when x and y are small enough for me to handle, and 5 otherwise. I would then be unable to city any fact about my dispositions that could constitute my meaning addition and which would be incompatible with the hypothesis I meant skaddition. 

Dispositions are thus unable to fix the meaning of the "+" sign.

Ok, well what if between incompatible and equally acceptable hypotheses, we could appeal to the *simplicity* of the respective hypotheses: it is the simplest function that should be deemed to have been meant.

KW's skeptic is scornful of this suggestion, not merely because "simplicity is relative, or that it is hard to define, or that a martian might find quus simpler than plus". These are problems, but KW suggests the difficulty is in fact more basic and relies on a misunderstanding of the nature of the conclusion of the argument.

The conclusion proper is not that there are two competing genuine hypotheses about what was meant. The conclusion of the argument is that no content can be attached to the hypothesis that a determinate meaning is attached to a given expression. Keeping that in mind, the appeal to simplicity considerations is misplaced. Simplicity is used to decide between competing hypotheses, but they cannot tell us what the competing hypothesis *are*. If we don't understand what the hypotheses *state*, what does it mean to say one is "more probable" because it is "simpler"? <-- Ok I was confused but this actually makes sense.

So none of the facts we've considered:
- Facts about previous behavior
- Facts about behavioral dispositions
- Facts about general thoughts or instructions
- Facts about "quotidian" mental states such as mental images
- Facts about *sui generis* and irreducible states of meaning and understanding
- Facts about "simplicity"

appear to be plausible candidates for constituting the fact we mean *addition* rather than *quaddition* by "+". We appear to be facing the conclusion that there is no fact of the matter as to what we meant in the past by "+", and since our present understanding of "+" will be up for retrospective viewing in the future, there is no fact of the matter as to what we mean at present by "+" either. Since the argument could, without any loss, be rerun against anyone else and any other linguistic expression, it follows that there are no facts of the matter as to what anyone means by any expression. The notion of meaning has apparently, as Kripke puts it, "vanished into thin air".

# The Skeptical Solution
---
There are two ways in which the skeptical argument might be responded to.
1. "Straight solution". This would consist of the production of a suitable meaning-constituting fact of the sort the skeptic questions.
2. "Skeptical solution". This solution consists of two parts:
	1. An admission that the sort of fact questioned by the skeptic is non-existent.
	2. An argument to the effect that an area of discourse does not have to be viewed as fact-stating in order for it to enjoy a tenable position within our lives.
	KW argues that our practice does not require for its tenability an account of their truth-conditions or facts which would render them true or false. We can justify our practice of ascribing meaning and understanding in other terms.

KW admits that sentences ascribing meanings do not have truth-conditions, there are no facts in virtue of which sentences have truth or falsity conferred upon them. 

We are enjoined not to look for "entities" or "facts" corresponding to sentences ascribing meaning but rather to look at the circumstances under which such ascriptions are actually made and the utility that resides in ascribing them under these conditions. If these conditions and the corresponding role can be specified adequately, then we will have provided a skeptical solution to the problem.

What are the relevant conditions, utility, and role? Consider the sentence "Jones means *addition* by '+'". If Jones is considered in isolation from any linguistic community, as a speaker of a solitary language, then the conditions under which this will be asserted will correspond to those under which Jones would assert "I mean addition by '+'".

There is thus no distinction between the assertion conditions of "Jones believe he means *addition* by '+'" and "Jones means *addition* by '+'". So whatever seems right to Jones will be right.

In the case of an individual considered in isolation, the skeptical solution will be powerless to salvage any point to our practices with the notion of meaning, since any such reconstruction must respect the fact that the meaning an individual speaker attaches to an expression is normative with respect to his inclinations to apply it in certain ways.

What if Jones is considered as a member of a linguistic community? The utterance is then considered to be justified when Jones has performed satisfactorily often enough with '+',  this is taken to involve nothing more than Jones giving satisfactory answers often enough, satisfactory here being the answer most of the rest of his speakers in the community are disposed to give. The utterance of the sentence marks the community's acceptance of Jones into its midst and marks the community's conviction that Jones can generally be trusted to act as they do in transactions which involve the use of the "+" sign. The utility of uttering ascriptions of meaning under such conditions is clear. It allows us to discriminate between those people we can trust in our transactions involving "+" and those we cannot. More generally it allows us to discriminate between people who are members of our general linguistic community and those who are not.

To sum up, the skeptical solution admits discourse involving meaning is not fact-stating, but attempts to legitimize it by finding it a non fact-stating role to play. This involves spelling out the assertability conditions of ascriptions of meaning and showing that asserting them under these conditions play a useful role in our lives. It emerges that these assertion conditions involve an essential reference to a linguistic community, since the community underwrites the "seems right/is right" distinction essential to any conception of meaning. The preservation of a legitimate role for ascriptions of meaning is thus claimed by KW to deliver a demonstration of the impossibility of solitary language.
# Kripke's Wittgenstein and Meaning-Skepticism
---
George Wilson argues most commentators misinterpret Kripke's Wittgenstein when they view him as *accepting* the conclusion of the skeptical argument and then trying to rehabilitate the notion of meaning by proposing a non-factualist account of ascriptions of meaning. Wilson rejects this: according to him, Kripke's skeptic argues as follows:

>(NS) If $X$ means something by the term ^$A$^, then there is a set of properties $P_1, ..., P_n$ that govern the correct application of ^$A$^ for $X$.
>
> (G) If there is a set of properties $P_1, ..., P_n$ that govern the correct application of ^$A$^ for $X$, then there are facts about $X$ that constitute $P_1, ..., P_n$ as the conditions that govern $X$'s use of ^$A$^
>
> (BSC) There are no facts about $X$ that constitute any set of properties as conditions that govern $X$'s use of ^$A$^.
>
> So, (RSC) No-one ever means anything by a term.

According's to Wilson, KW does not accept the "-radical skeptical conclusion" (RSC), but rather denies this, and uses this as a lever to reject the "classical realist" conception of meaning embodied in (NS). KW according to Wilson argues:

> (G), (BSC), not (RSC), so, not (NS).

This appears to sit ill with Kripke's remarks about the distinction between "straight" and "skeptical" solutions to the paradox. Kripke describes a skeptical solution as beginning by accepting the negative *conclusion* of the skeptical argument.

# Rule-Following and Meaning?
---
KW appears to raise a question about the factuality of ascriptions of meaning. But what does meaning have to do with rule-following? Boghossian argues that the answer is "nothing" and that the "rule-following considerations" is a misnomer.

Many writes assume there is a connection between rule-following and meaning because expressions come to have meaning as a result of people following rules in respect to them. But this won't do since on an ordinary understanding, following a rule is an intentional act. Far from explaining meaning, the notion of rule-following presupposes it. Hence the "misnomer" accusation.

However, one does not need to hold the explanatory claim, that expressions acquire meaning in virtue of our following rules in respect of them, in order to appreciate the connections between meaning and rule-following.

Suppose I intend to follow the rule "add 2" when writing out the following arithmetic series: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,... . Intuitively, certain continuations are determined to be correct by the rule which I intend to follow, and certain continuations are determined to be incorrect by that rule. This is the analogue of the applications of a predicate being determined as correct or incorrect by the meaning of the predicate.

Just as KW's skeptic will claim, of a predicate, that there are no facts of the matter as to which applications are correct and which are incorrect, he will also claim there are no facts of the matter as to which continuations of the series are correct or incorrect.
