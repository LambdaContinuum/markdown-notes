# Rules, Meaning, and Content
---
What does the notion of [[Introduction to Kripke's Wittgenstein On Rules and Private Langauge|rule-following]] have to do with the notion of linguistic meaning and mental content? Suppose I write out the beginning of an arithmetical series $$2, 4, 6, 8, 19, ...$$
If the rule I'm following is *add 2*, the continuation $$12, 14, 16, ...$$
is *correct*, in that it accords with the rule I'm following, while the continuation $$13, 19, 20, ...$$
is *incorrect*, in that it fails to accord with the rule I'm following.

We have an analogy with my meaning something by a linguistic expression. Say I mean *blue* by 'blue'. Then, 'blue' is correctly applicable to a US postbox but not to a ripe Tomato. We can express this point by saying that the former application accords with the predicate's meaning while the latter application fails to do so.

Rule-following therefore has consequences for our conception of linguistic meaning: if an argument shows that there are no facts about which rule an agent is following, it shows that there are no facts about what a speaker means by a linguistic expression.

The same notion of accord is in play in our conceptions of mental states with intentional content. Say that one intends to go the grocery store and shop for food. Then going to the store and shopping accords with one's intentions in the sense that it fulfills it, while staying at home to grade logic exams fails to accord with it. Say that one believes that the cat is on the mat. Then, the state of affairs in which the cat is on the mat accords with one's belief in the sense that it renders it true, while the state of affairs in which the cat is on the roof does not. And so on.

Arguments about rule-following have consequences for our conception of mental content: if an argument shows that there are no facts about what rule an agent is following, it shows there are no facts about the contents of a thinker's mental states.

Boghossian distinguishes between two broad type of views:
- *The Sellarsian View:* The notion of linguistic meaning is explanatorily prior to the notion of mental content.
- *The Gricean View:* The notion of mental content is explanatorily prior to the notion of linguistic content.

Irrespective of which these views is adopted, it will not be possible to develop a skeptical argument the exclusively targets linguistic meaning. On the Sellarsian View, the conclusion that there are no facts about linguistic meaning will ensure that there are no facts about mental content, since it's from the former sort of the fact that the latter sort of fact would have to be derived. On the Gricean view, raising skeptical doubt about linguistic meaning cannot be done without raising a skeptical doubt about mental content.

There's a third possible view:
- *The Davidsonian View:* The notions of mental content and linguistic meaning are explanatorily interdependent; neither takes explanatory priority over the other.

Clearly on this view, one cannot pose a skeptical threat to the existence of facts about meanings of linguistic expressions without threatening the existence of facts about mental content, and vice versa.

Boghossian makes the observation:
> ... that the arguments construct their skeptical case by exploiting features of content properties, but without exploiting any facts about the putative *bearers* of those properties. Thus, they would apply to anything said to possess content, whether it was mental or not.

We'll move freely between arguments about rule-following, linguistic meaning, and mental content.

# The Skeptical Argument
---
We'll start with an outline of the argument of [[The Wittgensteinian Paradox|Kripke's skeptic]].

Suppose I've never dealt with numbers larger than $57$. I'm asked to perform the computation '$68 + 57$', and I arrive at the answer '$125$' which I take to be right. However a "bizarre skeptic" questions my certainty. She suggests that in the past I used 'plus' and '$+$' to mean a different function, called "quaddition". Quaddition yields the same result as addition if the numbers are lower than $57$ and $5$ otherwise, so the correct result to the aforementioned computation is '$5$' not '$125$'. I should answer '$5$' if I intend to use 'plus' in the same way in which I have been using it in the past, or so the skeptic suggests.

Kripke allows that the skeptic's proposal is "absolutely wild", however it is not logically impossible and so there must be some fact about my past usage that can be cited to refute the skeptics hypothesis.

That is, there ***must*** be a fact about my past usage that determines that I meant *addition* by 'plus' in the past, and thus that (assuming I intend to use the expression in the same way I've been using it so far) I should answer '$125$' rather than '$5$'.

Importantly, the skeptic does not question my memory concerning past use; she goes as far to allow that the exercise of my cognitive power is faultless, and that I have access to all the facts about my mind and behavior that are potentially constitutive of my meaning one thing rather than another.

The idea is that if I'm not able, even in cognitively ideal conditions, to provide the fact in virtue of which I mean *addition* rather than the function quaddition, it's because there is no such fact. Furthermore, the focus is on past use because "if I use language at all, I cannot doubt coherently that 'plus' as I now use it, denotes plus". But, if the skeptic's challenge succeeds, it can be generalized, for if there was no such thing as my meaning plus rather than quus in the past, neither can there be any such thing in the present.

(The fact that the skeptic grants the idealization of our cognitive powers in the way that she does shows that her argument is not of a piece with the argument of the epistemological skeptic, who is concerned with whether our actual cognitive capacities can lead to knowledge.)

Kripke claims the search for a fact fails. Why does Kripke take the search to fail? Recall that all previous uses of '$+$' are compatible with my meaning *quaddition*, which is what enables the skeptic to say that I meant that all along. One might complain that the challenge operates from a "ridiculous model of instruction", which fails to take into account that a competent adder is to have internalized a general instruction or rule which justifies and determines my present response. The skeptic will reply that the worry can be raised again with respect to the general instruction or rule, which is just as susceptible to being interpreted in a deviant way as the initial expression.

Kripke then considers a variety of other candidates, which are the kernel of various philosophical theories, and argues on behalf of the skeptic that none of them succeed. Among the facts considered are:
- My being disposed to produce the sum.
- My instantiating a machine whose operations embody the function of addition.
- The simplicity of the addition hypothesis.
- My having a distinctive experience "with its own special quale, known directly" through introspection.
- My having an image in mind that supposedly singles out addition.
- My being in a primitive, irreducible state of meaning addition.
- My grasping an abstract entity, such as a Fregean sense, which singles out addition.

None of them, Kripke argues, is successful in ruling out the skeptic's hypothesis that I meant quaddition rather than addition.

What are the conditions meaning facts must meet? There is controversy in the literature about their nature and plausibility.

## The Extensionality Condition
To being, Kripke claims that whatever fact makes it the case that a speaker means addition by '$+$' must single out the addition function, as opposed to the quaddition function, as what is meant. It follows from this that the putative meaning-constituting fact must account for the conditions of correct application of '$+$'. The fact in which my meaning addition by '$+$' consists must single out '$4$' as the correct response to '$2 + 2$', and so on. Meaning facts render the applications of expressions correct or incorrect, and so a fact cannot count as a meaning-constituting fact unless it does this. This is an uncontroversial claim which most philosophers accept.

This is something on which those who seek to offer a reductive account of meaning and those who are skeptical about the prospects of reduction seem to agree. 

We'll call this first condition the *extensionality condition*. In the case of a predicate like 'green', it requires that the fact which constitutes its meaning determines the appropriate class of things to which 'green' is correctly applicable. This will be the class of green things as opposed to the class of *grue* things.

To see how a candidate might fail the extensionality condition, consider a simple form of dispositional theory of meaning which proposes as constitutive of my meaning addition the fact that I'm disposed to answer with the sum as opposed to the quum when faced with arithmetical queries. The skeptic argues that this fact doesn't single out the addition function:

> Let 'quaddition' be redefined so as to be a function which agrees with addition for all pairs of number small enough for me to have any disposition to add them, and let it diverge from addition thereafter. ... A dispositional account will be impotent to refute him.

## The Normativity Condition
The notion of correctness involved in the claim that meaningful expressions have conditions of correct application is *intrinsically normative*. On this reading, meaning facts are normative facts, they not only sort the applications of expressions into correct or incorrect, but also prescribe how expressions ought to be applied. They issue semantic categorical obligations that bind speakers in determine ways; the justified applications are precisely those that fulfill these semantic obligations.

To illustrate how this condition constrains accounts of meaning, consider Kripke's discussion of dispositionalism. He thinks the dispositionalist offers a descriptive account on the relation between what one means by an expression and one's use of that expression, but that this is not the proper account of the relation which is *normative* not descriptive.

Kripke thinks the relation of meaning and intention to future actions is normative, not descriptive. Thus construed, the skeptical argument can be compared to arguments in meta-ethics that purport to establish an error-theory of moral judgment.

Kripke's discussion has resulted in a vigorous debate about whether meaning really is normative, as well as about how the normativity of meaning is best understood.

Some commentators take the normativity conditions to amount to an agential requirement, one that primarily concerns the *applications* or *uses* of expressions. The thought is that meaningful uses of expression are not arbitrary. An adequate conception of meaning must be able to account for this. 

Note that all the construals of the second condition appear to put pressure on dispositionalism over and above that exerted by the extensionality condition. Prima facie, dispositional facts are facts about what we will or would do, not about what we ought to do; dispositional facts appear not to be essentially justificatory or hypothetically prescriptive; dispositions do not justify or rationalize their manifestations, and in making semantic judgement we do not typically engage with facts about our linguistic dispositions; lastly, it's unclear how a dispositional account of meaning could be rendered consistent with its intuitive first-person epistemology.

# The Skeptical Solution
---
If the skeptical argument is cogent, it seems to follow that there are no meaning-constituting facts. This appears to imply the paradoxical conclusion that "the entire idea of meaning vanishes into thin air". Kripke distinguishes between two broad ways in which one might attempt to avoid this conclusion.
- One might provide a *straight* response, by identifying some meaning-constituting fact of the sort called into question by the skeptic. The two most prominent types of straight responses in the literature are reductive dispositionalism and non-reductionism,
- One might provide a *skeptical* response. This consists in conceding there are no meaning-constituting facts of the sort demanded by the skeptic but deny that this leads to a paradoxical conclusion.

 The proponent of the [[The Solution and the 'Private Language' Argument|skeptical solution]] can be understood as rejecting eliminativism about our practices of ascribing meaning. Mirroring metaethics, the two most obvious paths available to her involve providing:
 - An error-theoretic account of ascriptions of meaning.
 - A non-factualist account of ascriptions of meaning.

Boghossian views these paths as forms of *irrealism* about meaning, content, and rules. A prominent general line of argument suggests that irrealist views of any area make presuppositions that irrealist views of meaning and content are bound to deny, so that irrealism about meaning and content is ultimately incoherent.

## Error Theories
Suppose we adopt an error theory: the view that all atomic, positive statements ascribing meaning, content, or the following of a rule, are false. Some error theories are eliminativist, but the error theorist need not subscribe to eliminativism.

For example, even if our practice of making moral judgement results in falsehoods, it meets a subsidiary norm in terms of whose satisfaction its pragmatic utility can be secured.

Might an error theorist about meaning, content, and rule-following attempt to avoid eliminativism by following a similar strategy?

It might seem that there is room for this approach. In the case of meaning, the subsidiary norm might be something like the following:  one ought to assert "Jones means addition by '$+$'" only when Jones's particular responses to arithmetical queries agree with those of the community in enough cases, especially the simple ones.

The norm would thus be cashed out in terms of *agreement* with respect to inclinations "to go on" in certain ways, and their utility of our complying with it would be that it enables us to make helpful discrimination's, for example, when seeking to buy five apples, between grocers whose inclinations match ours and grocers with "bizarre" quus-like inclinations.

This strategy might seem to be promising in the moral case, it faces special problems in the case of meaning, content, and rules. In order for the strategy to be able to so much as to be pursued, there has to *be* such a thing as complying or failing to comply with a subsidiary norm, and so *a fortiori* such a thing as complying or failing to comply with a norm as such. An error theorist about rule-following, however, denies *precisely* that there are facts about norm-compliance and non-compliance.

Having argues that all statements about rule-compliance are false, the error theorist lacks the resources for telling a story about the pragmatic utility of our continuing to engage in the practice of making judgments about rule-following. This means that if we accept there are no facts about speakers in virtue of which expressions have meaning, embracing an error theory will not prevent the notion of meaning from “vanishing into thin air”.

## Non-Factualist Theories
A non-factualist about a domain maintains that judgments and claims made within that domain are not in the business of stating facts. The standard view is that Kripke's Wittgenstein himself is proposing a form of semantic non-factualism in the skeptical solution. Might semantic non-factualism afford us a way to embrace the conclusion of the skeptical argument while avoiding eliminativism?

This move faces difficulties parallel to those faced by error theories. The non-factualist about meaning proposes that we construe ascriptions of meaning as having a purpose or function different from that of stating facts. But, insofar as a sentence is regarded as having a function, there is an intelligible distinction between correct and incorrect uses of that sentence; in other words, the sentence is rule-governed. That the notion of correctness in these cases cannot be identified with truth or warranted assertability makes no difference to the applicability of a generalized version of the extensionality condition. 

Suppose that '$S$' is a sentence that has a non-descriptive semantic function. Consider these two specifications of the conditions in which utter '$S$' is correct, where $R_1$ and $R_2$ would confer different correctness-values on utterances of $'S'$
1. Uttering $'S'$ is correct iff the conditions in which it is uttered according with $R_1$;
2. Uttering '$S$' is correct iff the conditions in which it is uttered according with $R_2$.

Whatever makes it the case that (1) provides the correctness conditions for utterances of '$S$' must rule out (2) as providing those conditions.

Consider, more specifically, the case of plans. Take the sentence 'Let's write a fugue!'. Consider two possible correctness conditions for it:
1. 'Let's write a fugue!', as uttered by Glenn, is correct iff Glenn plans to write a fugue

and 

2. 'Let's write a fugue!', as uttered by Glenn, is correct iff it is time $t$ earlier than $t*$ and Glenn plans to write a fugue or it is time $t$ later than or equal to $t*$ and Glenn plans to write a novel.

Glenn's finite nature together with the infinitude of the temporal sequence ensures that the skeptic will always be able to argue that no fact about Glenn is capable of ruling in something like (1) and ruling out something like (2).

So, a non-factualist account of any region of thought and talk would seem to presuppose a realist account of meaning, content, and rules according to which there are semantic facts, intentional facts, and facts about normative accord. It thus faces a charge of incoherence.

## An Alternate Form of Factualism
Wilson takes the lessons of the skeptical argument to be not that there are no meaning facts, but rather that a certain conception of such facts, which he calls *classical realism*, is hopeless and conceives of the skeptical solution as accommodating meaning facts when conceived in a different way.

Classical realism is sometimes referred to as semantic Platonism, the view that "the meanings of our words are guaranteed by the pre-existing structure of reality". What is essential to classical realism is that the properties that guarantee meaningfulness must be antecedently singled out by individuals in order to endow their words with semantic standards.

Zalbardo puts it as what is required is

> a conscious act in which I decide to pair the predicate with the property in such a way that the satisfaction conditions of the predicate, as I mean it, are determined by the instantiation conditions of the property.

Wilson takes the skeptical challenge to reveal that no sense can be made of this idea, for it's not possible for an individual non-linguistically to single out properties as "the *de re* subject of her meaning-constituting intentions". But what this allegedly shows is not that there are no meaning facts, but rather we must reform our conception of them.

The alternative picture of meaning Wilson fleshes out conceives of expressions as not connected to properties that serve as "pre-established" standards of correctness, and suggests that what we mean by an expression is something that gets settled only over the course of time. It has been argued that this is susceptible to collapsing into a form of subjectivism, and that it is untenable for it falls prey to the skeptical challenge that it purports to bypass.

It has also been argued that classical realism is merely an instance of a more general conception of meaning that takes standards of correctness to be determined by entities that are considered independently of how we might describe them linguistically; it is this conception that must be rejected, as it's ultimately responsible for generating the paradox.

# Reductive Dispositionalism
---
The most widely discussed attempt at a straight solution to the skeptical challenge is reductive dispositionalism. The fact that Jones has the concept of *addition* rather than *quaddition* so to be identified with his disposition to produce the result of adding the numbers $x$ and $y$ in response to arithmetical queries.

The account is intended to be reductive, insofar as the content-determining dispositions are characterized in wholly non-semantic and non-intentional terms.

The skeptic argues that dispositionalist theories face three problems.
1. The finitude problem, much like our previous linguistic behavior our dispositions are finite. Given that the extension of the addition function is infinite, Jones's meaning addition by '+' cannot be identified with her dispositions to respond to arithmetical queries since it is simply false that she is disposed to answer with the sum when faced with the query 'x + y'. The numbers involved may be so large that Jones's brain's capacity for computation is far exceeded, and Jones may even die long before she is able to grasp the relevant numbers. Call such numbers "inaccessible".
2. The error problem, people may be systematically disposed to make mistakes. If what is meant is determined by dispositions we are forced to say that people actually mean some non-standard function.
3. The normativity problem, dispositionalist views seem unable to capture the *normativity* of meaning. Given what she means by '+', Jones ought to respond to arithmetical queries of the form 'x + y' by producing the sum of x and y, but the meaning-constituting fact proposed by the dispositionalist is at most a fact about how she would respond to queries of the relevant form.

Remember as Kripke says, "The point is *not* that, if I meant addition by '+', I will answer '125", but that if I intend to accord with my past meaning of '+', I should answer '125'. Computational error, finiteness of my capacity, and other disturbing factors may lead me not to be disposed to respond as I should, but if so, I have not acted in accordance with my intentions. The relation of meaning and intention to future action is *normative*, not *descriptive*."

Blackburn responds by arguing that even though Jones has no disposition to answer queries involving inaccessible numbers, responding with the sum is what Jones would be disposed to do were her dispositions in accessible cases allowed to manifest themselves in inaccessible cases. 

Some argue that solving the finitude problem turns on solving the error problem. Jared Warren proceeds to give a solution:

The fact which constitutes Jones's meaning addition by '+' is the fact that, when faced with arithmetical queries involving the '+' sign, Jones is stably disposed to reply with the sum in the overwhelmingly majority of normal situations. 

Normal situations are those in which neither external nor internal factors are interfering with Jones's general cognitive functioning. To say that Jones's disposition to respond with the sum is stable is to say that, as the number of arithmetical queries she has faced increases, the ratio of answers that give something other than the sum to answers that give the sum tend towards zero. We don't require that in normal conditions it is *metaphysically impossible*  for Jones to answer with something other than the sum. We only require that, when such conditions obtain, it is rational to be *nearly certain* she'll answer with the sum. The disposition described here is called DISP. DISP corresponds to the meaning-constituting dispositions that Warren proposes as offering a solution to the error problem.

This faces issues. The error problem arises as a result of the fact that the following two possibilities are consistent with Jones's possession of DISP.
1. Jones means addition by '+' and is responding correctly to the relevant queries.
2. Jones means some quus-like function and is responding incorrectly.

Warren needs a characterization of normal situations such that the latter possibility is ruled out. This means what is required is a characterization of normal situations such that, when those situations obtain, we are entitled to be nearly certain that Jones will answer with the sum, *and that in answering with the sum Jones is responding correctly.* The trouble is that there is an infinite range of functions $F_1, ..., F_n$ that have different extensions from the addition function. If Jones means some function $F_i$ among them, and if she answers with the sum, she would be answering incorrectly.

The question that drives Kripke's Wittgenstein's objection is: how could this be achieved other than through the inclusion of a clause in the characterization of normal situations to the effect that Jones means addition by '+'?

How could the obtaining of a non-semantically characterized set of situations have the effect of excluding every member of an open-ended and infinite set of semantically or intentionally characterized states of affairs?

The dispositionalist account offered by Warren either fails to resolve indeterminacy or does so at the expense of deploying semantic and intentional notions which is inconsistent with its reductive aspirations.

## Lewis on Natural Properties
A reductionist position that has been somewhat neglected in the rule-following literature is suggested by David Lewis.

Take a predicate like 'green'. The totality of facts about our previous use and dispositions to use 'green' are *consistent* with it referring to the property *green* but also with it referring to the property *grue*. So what might ground the claim that the property *green* is somehow privileged as the referent of 'green'? Lewis can be taken to advocate a form of "interpretationism" according to which semantic facts are constitutively determined by the best theory of the data.

Among the [[Kinds of Truths|a priori]] constitutive constraints governing what counts as the best theory is a principle requiring referents assigned to expressions be the most natural of those consistent with the data. Since *green* is more natural than *grue*, it is more "eligible" than grue to be assigned to 'green' as its referent. In this way, the indeterminacy left open by facts about use is fended off.

Such a proposal is not *ad hoc* as the notion of a natural property that it utilities is required by David Lewis's account of laws of nature. However, its application to rule-following faces a number of challenged.

1. It's not obvious how it extends to mathematical examples. Boghossian writes, "I see no obvious notion of naturalness that will cover both the notion of a natural property, as it might figure in an account of similarity or lawlikeness, and that of a natural function."
2. Even if it meets the extensionality condition, it cannot meet the normativity condition.
3. It's also likely to be challenged on epistemic grounds similar to those used by Kripke and Wright in dismissing the suggestion that quaddition can be ruled out in light of the fact that the hypothesis that Jones meant quaddition is less simple than the hypothesis that meant addition. A speaker can know that in response to the query '68 + 57', '125' is the answer that accords with what she meant by '+', without having to infer this from facts about her previous linguistic behavior. In recognizing that the answer '125' fits what we mean by '+', we do not proceed by inference to the best semantic explanation of our previous uses of that expression. But this is what we would have to do if the "simplicity" suggestion were correct: the best explanation would be yielded by the simplest of the hypotheses consistent with our previous linguistic behavior. The simplicity suggestion thus apparently makes a mystery of our non-inferential semantic knowledge. Lewis's suggestions will be challenged on similar grounds. We do not infer what we mean by '+' from facts about naturalness together with constitutive principles governing interpretation. The account makes a mystery of the non-inferential nature of much of our semantic knowledge. It faces difficulties in accommodating the *authority* normally credited to self-ascriptions of meaning. For Lewis, in virtue of the role they play in his account of scientific laws, simplicity and naturalness are objective notions. However, a speaker's opinions about what she means, unlike her opinions about the structure of the world, are generally authoritative, unless there are special reasons to doubt them. What might the basis for this default authority be, if what she means is determined by facts about simplicity and naturalness?
4. The Lewisian view seems to be a form of semantic Platonism, in so far as it upholds the idea that our meaning what we do by our words is guaranteed by the structure of reality. But its a radical form of semantic Platonism, in so far as it seems to leave no room for the speaker's contribution to the singling out of properties. It's vulnerable to a complaint to the effect that subjective perspective of the thinker or speaker is entirely annihilated.

# Non-Reductionism
---
The very serious problems we outlined for the dispositionalist conception of meaning have been taken by a number of philosophers to show we ought resist the temptation to explain meaning and content in more basic terms. How might one formulate a non-reductionist position?

On Stroud's view, it amounts to denying that we can explain the phenomena of meaning and understanding "from outside" them, as it were, without attributing intentional attitudes or supposing that anything means anything or is understood in a certain way to those whose understanding is being accounted for.

More generally, we might say that the facts constitutive of the semantic domain cannot be characterized or explained in non-semantic terms, that is, without employing the notions of meaning or understanding; the facts constitutive of rule-following cannot be characterized or explained without employing the notion of rule-following.

Some philosophers who embrace the view also defend the view that according to which semantic facts do not supervene on anything; they are metaphysically fundamental. Boghossian relies on the finitude problem to argue that, if meaning facts are determinate, then they cannot supervene on non-semantic facts. However, the denial of supervenience is not essential to non-reductionism. At the core of position is the idea that any attempt to account for meaning in more basic terms is hopeless or philosophically confused.

Kripke briefly considers the possibility that the states of meaning, or facts about meaning, are primitive or *sui generis*. He cashes it out as the idea that
> meaning addition by "plus" ... is simply a primitive state, not to be assimilated to sensations or headaches or any "qualitative" states, nor to be assimilated to dispositions, but a state of a unique kind of its own.


Kripke raises two complaints against this approach.
1. He characterizes it as desperate, insofar as "it leaves the nature of this postulated primitive sate ... completely mysterious", for such an approach does not provide an account of what makes it possible for one to "be confident that one does, at present" mean what one does.
2. He thinks that a non-reductionist account does not address the "logical difficulty implicit in Wittgenstein's skeptical argument", which is that it would seem that we could not "conceive of a finite state which *could* not be interpreted in a quus-like way".

Some claim Kripke's treatment of the non-reductionist position is unsatisfactory.

Boghossian thinks that what Kripke needs for his treatment of non-reductionism to succeed is an argument from queerness aiming to show that there is something inherently queer about meaning properties, which he fails to provide.

Some proponents of non-reductionism think Kripke's skeptical challenge is based on confusion, and that our task is to unearth confusion. On their view, the proper response is not to *solve* the skeptical problem by showing that the skeptic failed properly to acknowledge some set of facts, but to *dissolve* it by showing that there is, in fact, no problem. McDowell argues that Kripke misunderstands the dialect. On his view

> the right response to the paradox, Wittgenstein in effect tells us, is not to accept it but to correct the misunderstanding on which it depends,

which puts us in a position to dissolve the paradox and, with it, the problem of how meaning is possible. This involves renouncing the problematic assumption that understanding an expression requires interpreting that expression.

More generally we ought to resist the thought that

> whatever is in a person's mind at any time, it needs interpretation if it is to sort items outside the mind into those that are in accord with it and those that are not

Similarly, Stroud thinks that the paradox is an expression of an unsatisfiable demand, namely, the demand for some facts, the recognition of which would not require that we already speak and understand a language, and some rules, which would tell us what, given those facts, it was correct to say.

It might be argued that the urgency of this question is merely a symptom of a frame of mind from within which meaning seems impossible, and our proper task is to leave this confused frame of mind behind. 

Even though the project of providing necessary and sufficient conditions for meaning is hopeless, the non-reductionist can still aspire to articulate necessary conditions that aren't even remotely trivial, and draw illuminating connections between meaning and other irreducible phenomenon. Through a reconstruction of Davidson's triangulation argument, Verheggen argues that interactions with a second individual and aspects of the shared world is a necessary condition for one's having a language and thoughts. The constitution of the standards of correctness that govern language and thought necessitates that the individual be aware of the possibility of being mistaken, an awareness that can only be grounded in linguistic interactions with another individual and features of the world.

Some offer arguments to the effect that the adoption of a non-reductionist view of meaning does not secure the intelligibility of the idea of a guidance by a rule. According to Wright, the only way in which rule-following can be understood is if it conforms to what he calls "the modus ponens model". The model states that an act is a genuine instance of rule-following if it can be rationalized by, on the one hand, citing the rule, and on the other, indicating that the circumstances, which must be specifiable without appealing to the rule, call for its application. Wright argues that if we assume the modus ponens model applies to cases of language use, we are saddled with an Augustinian picture, according to which conceptual capacities are necessarily prior to capacities to use language. He accepts that Wittgenstein has revealed the bankruptcy of the Augustinian picture; so the idea of antecedent conceptual capacities is unintelligible. This is taken to show that the modus ponens model cannot apply to basic cases. This is called "the minor premise problem".

Boghossian also relies on the modus ponens model to argue that a non-reductionist position does not allow us to make sense of the intelligibility of rule-following. He offers an intuitive characterization of the phenomenon of rule-following, according to which it has the following structure:

> a state that can play the role of rule-acceptance; and some non-deviant causal chain leading from that state to a piece of behavior that would allow us to say that the rule explains and (in the personal-level case) rationalizes the behavior in question.

What allows us to say that the rule explains and rationalizes the behavior is an act of inference from the rule to what it requires in particular contexts. But inference is an example of rule-following *par excellence*, which indicates that the act of inference must fit the intuitive characterization above, thus requiring a further act. A regress is unavoidable for the proponent of non-reductionism. This is the inference problem.

Arguably, the two problems are anticipated in Kripke's line of reasoning, to the effect that the non-reductionist view faces a logical difficulty. The difficulty seems to arise from three claims that seem uncontroversial but are inconsistent:

1. The state of meaning plus by '+' must guide the speaker in her applications of the expression '+';
2. A state of meaning can be interpreted in more than one way;
3. Something that can be interpreted in more than one way cannot guide.

We might think that one's state of meaning something by an expression is not the sort of thing one can interpret (thus denying 2), or whether something can be interpreted in more than one way is irrelevant for the question of whether it can guide (thus denying 3), but neither of these options entitles us to reject 1, the non-reductionist still owes us an account of what it is to be guided by a rule.

Miller argues that the inference problem and the minor premise problem are not genuine difficulties for the non-reductionist. In applying a rule R in a particular case there need be no further inferential step, over and above that involving R itself, mediating between acceptance of R and that particular application.

This is just what it is for rule-following not to be a matter of interpretation: the rule is applied immediately, as it were without mediation of a further rule, such as an inference rule, in the manner suggested by Boghossian, or a rule for the deployment of a prior concept, in the manner suggested by Wright. What puts an agent in a position to follow a rule is her having been trained into a practice of following rules of that sort, where the notion of training, practice, and custom are semantically characterized and cannot receive further philosophical illumination.

Thus, rule-following has an essentially social character. One dispute that is intramural to the non-reductionist approach concerns the precise way in which this social character should be understood. When it comes to meaning, Verheggen distinguishes between [[Introduction to Wittgenstein, Rules and Institutions|communitarian]] views according to which having a first language essentially depends on meaning by one's words what members of some community means by them and interpersonalist views according to which having a first language essentially depends on having used one's words to communicate with others.

Some seek a middle ground, Ginsgborg explains meaning in terms of normativity that she takes to be primitive. One this view, for someone to mean something by an expression is for her to have a disposition to apply it in particular contexts and to take the manifestations of that disposition to be appropriate. Taking one's response to be appropriate does not depend on the antecedent grasp of a rule or standard determining that response as correct rather than correct, or even on the awareness that there is such a rule or standard. This establishes the primitive status of the notion of appropriateness.
