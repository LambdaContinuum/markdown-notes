# Kripke on Wittgenstein and Chomsky
---
In [[Introduction to Kripke's Wittgenstein On Rules and Private Langauge|Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language]], Kripke presents a reading of Wittgenstein that depicts him as a type of skeptic about meaning and rule-following. He makes a few suggestive remarks concerning the possible threat that Wittgenstein's argument pose for Chomsky's linguistic project.

He writes

> Modern transformational linguistics, inasmuch as it explains all my specific utterances by my “grasp” of syntactic and semantic rules generating infinitely many sentences with their interpretation, seems to give an explanation of the type Wittgenstein would not permit.

Kripke singles out the notion of "competence", which is central to Chomsky's linguistics and is threatened by the Wittgensteinian considerations:

> Nevertheless, given the skeptical nature of Wittgenstein’s solution to his problem … it is clear that if Wittgenstein’s standpoint is accepted, the notion of “competence” will be seen in a light radically different from the way it implicitly is seen in much of the literature on linguistics. For if statements attributing rule-following are neither to be regarded as stating facts, nor to be thought of as explaining our behavior … it would seem that the use of the ideas of rules and of competence in linguistics needs serious reconsideration, even if these notions are not rendered “meaningless”. 

His point seems to be that the notion of linguistic competence is only as legitimate as the notion of rule-following because the former is defined in terms of the latter. The Wittgensteinian challenge to rule-following is thus thereby a challenge to the notion of competence; and this would be the case even if the challenge is not strictly of a skeptical nature.

Kripke also suggests that there may be an important sense in which Chomsky and Wittgenstein are in agreement in their conceptions of language.

> On the other hand, some aspects of Chomsky’s views are very congenial to Wittgenstein’s conception. In particular, according to Chomsky, highly species-specific constraints – a “form of life” – lead a child to project, on the basis of exposure to a limited corpus of sentences, a variety of new sentences for new situations. There is no a priori inevitability in the child’s going on in the way he does, other than that this is what the species does. As already said in note 22, the matter deserves a more extended discussion.

There are then two main points that Kripke makes regarding the relation between his interpretation of Wittgenstein and Chomsky's linguistic project.
1. There is the potentially negative impact which would at least force a reconsideration of the core notions of Chomsky's project.
2. There are features that are common to Chomsky and Wittgenstein concerning linguistic competence, such as that we have certain shared natural inclinations (a shared "form of life") to extrapolate from a limited learning base in the same ways.

The importance of addressing these issues is highlighted by Chomsky himself when he writes:

> Of the various general critiques that have been presented over the years concerning the program and conceptual framework of generative grammar, this \[Kripke’s Wittgenstein’s challenge] seems to me to be the most interesting.

This leads Chomsky to devote an entire chapter of his *Knowledge of Language* to responding to the challenge articulated by Kripke.

# Wittgenstein's target: Logical compulsion
---
Here we will outline the conception of meaning and rule-following that Wittgenstein attacks.

In the *Philosophical Investigations* Wittgenstein is concerned with the relation between mental states such as understanding, intention, picturing, etc., on the one hand, and the behavior or states of affairs that 'accord' with them, on the other. For example, understanding the meaning of a word seems to be something that happens in a particular instant. But this surely something different from the 'use' which is extended in time. This leads him to inquire into the relation between these two aspects: that which we seem to grasp in an instant when we understand a word; and the use we go on to make of that word over time.

How we go on using a word must "accord" in some sense with what we grasp when we understand the word. For example, applying the word "green" to this apple that I encounter must fit or accord with the meaning of this word that I grasped beforehand, even though my grasp of this meaning did not involve thinking of this or countless other instances of the use of the word. What is the relation between the rule that we grasp and its extended pattern of correct application, or between forming an intention to do something and the behavior that counts as fulfilling that intention, etc.? Wittgenstein's main concern is with the confusions that very easily arise when attempting to make sense of these relations.

This confusion is best characterized by considering his distinction between logical and psychological compulsion. Wittgenstein's first explicit mention of the distinction is in the context of discussing what it means to say that a particular application of a word "forces" itself on us. In what sense are we compelled to apply a word in a particular way?

Wittgenstein considers the example of the word "cube". It is possible that when I understand the word, a picture of a cube comes before my mind. But does this compel me to apply it only to objects of a certain shape? Wittgenstein says it's quite easy to imagine a method of projection according to which the picture does fit, say, a "triangular prism". It would indeed be a non-standard method for applying it but it is nonetheless conceivable. The point that Wittgenstein makes with this example is that there may be a way of applying a word like "cube" that strikes most of us as natural and hence that we tend to agree on. We apply it to these square-shaped objects and not to these triangular-shaped ones. Call this "psychological compulsion". We can all be compelled in this sense even though it is in principle possible for there to be a non-standard way of applying it that deviates from it.

The confusion arises when we attempt to formulate a stronger sense of compulsion, call it logical compulsion, that is based on more than how we are in fact naturally compelled to apply a word.

Wittgenstein raises the question of whether we can make sense of this stronger sense of compulsion, i.e. whether we are actually acquainted with it.

We shall argue that Wittgenstein does reject the notion of logical compulsion. Then we'll focus on whether Chomsky's project is reliant upon the targeted notion.

# Wittgenstein's argument against logical compulsion
---
It's quite common to attribute two main lines of argument to Wittgenstein in the discussion of rule-following a meaning, there is no consensus on how to characterize these arguments or their relations to one another. See some here: [[Rule Following - SEP]].

The first argument usually attributed to Wittgenstein is a regress argument, designed to show that the assumption that rule-following and meaning require an act of interpretation leads to an infinite regress of interpretations, thus failing to determine the meaning of a term or the requirements of a rule.

The main concern here will be with another argument. We'll refer to it as the gerrymandering argument, Brandom's label. This is also the argument that Kripke focuses on in his interpretation and the one Chomsky attempts to respond to.

Wittgenstein's gerrymandering argument is also important in the present discussion because it provides a more plausible argument against the notion of logical compulsion. When attempting to formulate it, it's helpful to distinguish between two main aspects to the conception of meaning that arise in Wittgenstein's discussion:

1. The meaning of a term is an abstract standard for the correct application of the term.
2. The meaning of a term (as construed in the first aspect) succeeds in sorting the applications of the term into those that accord with this meaning and those that do not.

When taken together, these two aspects amount to a platonist or realist conception of meaning. The second aspect is much more prominent in Wittgenstein's writings. Wittgenstein addresses in his discussions of the act of meaning as "a queer process", or an activity that takes place in a "queer kind of medium"

One of Wittgenstein's most well-known characterizations of it is in his discussion of the example of a child being taught how to "Add 2". The child extends the series as we do up to "1000", but then diverges from us writing "1004",  "1008", etc. Furthermore, the child takes himself to be following the rule he was taught, to be continuing on in the same way. The teacher objects that writing "1004" after "1000" does not accord with the rule of "Add 2" as he *meant* it to be taken. But now we come up against this mysterious act of meaning because the teacher cannot say that he thought of "1002" as the next step, or thought of "1004" as the step after "1002", etc. And yet there must be some sense in which writing "1002" rather than "1004" accords with the meaning that the teacher attached to "Add 2".

The notion of logical compulsion is captured by this distinction between the two aspects of meaning. It corresponds to the second aspect, or the conception of meaning as determining in advance the pattern of correct application of a term. Now, Wittgenstein's regress and gerrymandering arguments and their relation to one another can bow be characterized in relation to this notion.

Under one formulation of the regress argument, that suggested in Brandom and Wright, the regress arises by virtue of the assumption that the interpretation of a sign determines its meaning in the sense of the first aspect above. That is, it's assumed that the act of interpretation fixes a standard for the correct application of the sign. But the regress arises because it is questioned that such meanings or standards themselves can logically compel us to apply them in such and such a way in particular instances. It is from this questioning of logical compulsion that the need arises for a further meaning or standard for applying it but which in turn does not logically compel us and so calls for a further meaning or standard, etc. Hence, this version of the regress argument can only function by directly challenging the notion of logical compulsion.

The gerrymandering argument can also be seen to concern the notion of logical compulsion, but in a more complicated way. It does not *directly* challenge the notion of logical compulsion. Rather, this argument functions by assuming the legitimacy of this notion. It then proceeds to show that making this assumption leads us into difficulties and in particular that it leads to the paradox stated that there is neither accord nor conflict because any action can count as according or conflicting. 

Assume the legitimacy of the notion of logical compulsion. If this assumption is in place, then we would have to hold that *if* the child does mean the rule of *Add 2* by the expression "Add 2", then the child should (is logically compelled to) write "1002" after "1000"; and if this child meant the deviant rule, then he should write "1004" after "1000". But then we can extend this to any person's use of any term and ask how can we tell that they attach the "standard" meaning of the term rather than some "deviant" meaning that logically compels them to diverge from us in their use of term. Can they point to some state of the person in virtue of which we can conclude that they have attached the standard meaning rather than the deviant meaning to it? It's difficult to see what such a state would be like. That a person's having grasped a deviant meaning would only show up when their application of the term starts to deviate from ours and they insist that they are carrying on in the same way. However, we are facing the paradox that any application of a term that one supposedly understands can be construed as either according or conflicting with how one has always meant that term. There is always some deviant meaning that we can appeal to as what we meant all along by the term and that logically compels us to apply it in this way that diverges from everyone else. But now the whole notion of according or conflicting with a rule of meaning breaks down because "if everything can be made out to accord with the rule, then it can also be made out to conflict with it. And so there would be neither accord nor conflict here."

The response to this is not to accept this paradoxical conclusion but to reject the problematic assumption that leads to this conclusion. To reject the assumption that meaning or rule-following requires the notion of logical compulsion.\

To conclude, the relation between Wittgenstein’s gerrymandering argument and the notion of logical compulsion is as follows. The argument assumes that the notion of logical compulsion is legitimate, and thus that understanding a word or following a rule is a matter of being logically compelled to apply the word or rule in particular ways – in accordance with its “predetermined” pattern of correct application. But the only way to maintain this assumption is to avoid the absurd or paradoxical conclusion that anything one does can be construed as applying the word in accordance with its meaning or following a rule; and the most straightforward way of avoiding this conclusion is to identify some distinctive state of the person in which grasping the “standard” meaning rather than the “deviant” meaning consists. In the absence of such a distinctive state constituting the standard meaning, the paradoxical conclusion will be derived and the original assumption concerning logical compulsion will ultimately have to be rejected.

# Chomsky, Linguistic Competence, and Wittgenstein's Gerrymandering Argument
---
Evaluating the potential challenge that Wittgenstein creates for Chomsky is complicated by the fact that there have been numerous manifestations of Chomsky's project of generative grammar.

We'll focus on the version referred to as the "Principles and Parameters" theory, first developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s and usually considered to be his most significant contribution to linguistics. Many of the core notions associated with his project as present in his earlier works, such as phrase structure rules, the distinction between deep and surface grammar, and universal grammar. But in his P&P theory, these concepts are modified and incorporated into a more elegant and powerful linguistic framework. Most notably, universal grammar is held to consist of different principles, each of which belong to a particular "module", and is applicable to one or more levels of grammatical structure. Some of these universal principles permit of "parametric variation", which means that they can determine what is grammatical or ungrammatical for particular languages in different ways. For example, the linear order of a phrase head, such as a verb, and its complement is not set by the relevant principle (of X-bar Theory), and is set in one way in English and another in Japanese. The goal of Chomsky's linguistic project thus becomes that of identifying the universal grammatical principles underlying all languages, as well as the parameters and the kind of parametric variation possible in different languages.

None of this has yet any bearing on the issues raised by Wittgenstein. These perspectives become much closer when we consider how Chomsky incorporates this linguistic framework into an account of language acquisition, or of how a person becomes "competent" in understanding and using a particular language. The core notion in this account is that of a "language module" or "faculty of language". Chomsky's conception of linguistic competence is in terms of the different possible "states" of the language faculty. There is the state we are born with, or the "initial state", that contains the principles of UG. The actual learning of a language such as English occurs by being exposed to that language, learning the lexicon, and setting the parameters, which are not set in the initial state.

When we become competent in a particular language, Chomsky holds that our language faculty has arrived at the mature state in which these factors such as the setting of the parameters in particular ways have been realized.

We will focus exclusively on the kind of "syntactical" knowledge that is involved in knowing, e.g., the linear order in which sentences of a particular language must be constructed, in accordance with certain principles and set parameters. This central part of his conception of linguistic competence in terms of states of the language faculty is potentially threatened by Wittgenstein's argument.

We will first connect it with the previous discussion and consider whether Chomsky's project presupposed the notion of logical compulsion. Take the example of the "Head-Direction Parameter". In the Chomskyan P&P account, this parameter is not set by the relevant principle in the initial state of the language faculty. Depending on the particular language the child is exposed to, this parameter can be set in one way or another, e.g. in the case of English as "head-initial" rather than "head-final". Therefore, staying with the case of learning English, it is only in the experiencing of particular examples of English sentences with phrases in which the verb-head is prior to its complement that this parameter is set in the child's language faculty. A significant part of the child becoming linguistically competent thus involves extrapolating from these examples to select the "head-initial" value of this parameter. Becoming competent in this way shaped his comprehension and production of future examples of sentences of various head-complement forms.

This analysis allows us to bring in the distinction between psychological and logical compulsion. If our concern is merely with psychological compulsion, then the only relevant issue is that as a matter of fact most of us tend to extrapolate from a similar learning base in the same, that we are all inclined to respond to similar examples of English sentences by selecting the same value for the Head-Direction parameter, and comprehending and constructing new sentences in accordance with this value. With regard to the stronger notion of logical compulsion, there is the further question of the *correct* and *incorrect* way to speak and write new examples of English sentences with head-complement form given that the Head-Direction parameter has been set in a certain way. It seems appropriate to interpret Chomsky's account as concerned with the notion of logical compulsion, i.e., with the process of setting the parameters for the particular language as determining the correct and incorrect ways of constructing sentences of a certain form in that language.

There is nothing wrong with presupposing the notion of logical compulsion if Chomsky is able to provide a straight response to Wittgenstein's gerrymandering argument. This is because Wittgenstein takes this notion to be problematic on the grounds that no state of the person can be found that satisfies the criteria of logical compulsion. But if Chomsky can give an account of such a state then he will have a straight response. Can Chomsky use his account of linguistic competence to provide such a response to Wittgenstein's gerrymandering argument?

It's easy to formulate the challenge posed by the gerrymandering argument within the Chomskyan framework. Imagine that a person, whose production of English sentences with verb-phrases and their complements has until now conformed to ours, suddenly says:

I the book to John gave

Other people may correct him by saying that "gave" (the verb-head) should occur at the beginning of the sentence. But if the person cannot see how this differs from how he used it in other instances and insists that he is just continuing to construct sentences in the way he was taught, what are others to say? The situation is analogous to the child who deviates from "Add 2".

In the Chomskyan case, we could just say that he person has understood the head-complement word-order to be "head-initial" prior to a certain time, and "head-final" after that time. The challenge that Wittgenstein's gerrymandering argument poses is to identify a state of the person, i.e., a state of his language faculty, that shows that his linguistic competence is such that he has set the Head-Direction Parameter in a standard way rather than a deviant way.

The problem for Chomsky is that there is nothing further that he can appeal to in responding to this challenge. He can hold that there is a certain mature (I-language) state of child's language faculty in virtue of which saying "I the book to John gave" is incorrect or ungrammatical. But the only evidence that Chomsky can appeal to in support of this view is indistinguishable from the evidence that could be appealed to in support of the alternative view that the child has set the parameter in the deviant way.

The conclusion that anything that anybody says or writes can be justified according to some (admittedly deviant) conception of the setting of the parameters cannot be avoided; and so it turns out that Chomsky’s commitment to the notion of logical compulsion is indeed problematic.

# Chomsky's Individualism and Logical Compulsion
---
According to Chomsky, the feature of his linguistic account that is potentially most vulnerable is its individualist standpoint, or "the individual psychology framework of generative grammar". More specifically, this feature is threatened by the argument against "private language" that Kripke maintains is a consequence of Wittgenstein's reflection on rule-following and meaning. Chomsky thus devotes a considerable part of his chapter on Wittgenstein to defending his individualist conception against this threat.

This diagnosis of the challenge conceals a number of separate issues that must be distinguished before we proceed.

We should make the distinction between Wittgenstein's negative arguments concerning meaning and rule-following (primarily the regress and gerrymandering arguments) and Wittgenstein's positive view of our everyday practices of using words and following rules. Kripke interprets Wittgenstein’s emphasis on practices and customs of use in terms of adopting a different perspective on language, viz. a move away from the concern with identifying states of the person that are constitutive of rule-following and meaning, and instead focusing on the conditions under which we take someone to be justified in asserting that he or someone else follows a rule or means something by a term. We want to highlight that he takes Wittgenstein to be adopting a [[Introduction to Wittgenstein, Rules and Institutions|communitarian]] conception of language because the “assertability conditions” for statements concerning rule-following and meaning make “reference to a community”. One of Kripke’s main interpretive claims is that the impossibility of private language follows as a “corollary” from this communitarian conception because the reference to the community in the assertability conditions make ascriptions of meaning and rule-following “inapplicable to a single person considered in isolation”

And so we can say from the negative arguments that the impossibility of logical compulsion comes about. And from the positive picture the impossibility of private language comes about.

The impossibility of private language follows from the positive communitarian conception of language, not from the negative arguments or the conclusion that rejects logical compulsion.

Chomsky seems to view his main task as that of responding to the private language argument. Hence, Chomsky’s emphasis on the private language issue potentially misses the main point, or misidentifies the main threat to his project.

We will initially take it for granted that Kripke is right about Wittgenstein’s positive conception, i.e. that he has such a conception and that it is communitarian. This, in any case, is how Chomsky views it and he responds to it as such.

Chomsky begins his counter-argument to the Wittgensteinian communitarian conception by outlining a number of different cases in which there are genuine instances of rule-following, but there is no communal agreement in how the rule should be applied. Chomsky argues that a Robinson Crusoe from birth or a radically socially isolated individual can be viewed as following rules.

He interprets Kripke’s claim that “Our community can assert of any individual that he follows a rule if he passes the tests for rule following applied to any member of the community” (1982: 110) as meaning that if we consider Crusoe as a “person” and “take him into the broader community of persons”, then we can attribute rule-following to him even though his responses are different to ours. In such a case, we can call Crusoe a rule-follower, although it may not be clear exactly what rule he is following. Chomsky, though, holds that this is merely an “exotic” example of private rule-following, and that there are numerous “standard” or “normal” cases.

> Suppose that we have visitors from a dialect area different from ours… where people say “I want for to do it myself” or “he went to symphony” instead of “I want to do it myself” and “he went to the symphony”. Again, we would say that they are following rules, even though their responses are not those we are inclined to give, and we do not take them into our linguistic community in these respects.

The common feature of these examples is that they are, for Chomsky, genuine instances of rule-following even though the individual or group does not agree with us in their responses or in how they follow the rules.

Chomsky suggests a way in which the Wittgensteinian argument could be extended to incorporate these cases. Chomsky states that there is an ambiguity in Wittgenstein’s notion of “form of life” that may be exploited to save him from this objection.

Drawing on Kripke’s discussion, Chomsky makes a distinction between two senses of form of life. The first sense is narrower and pertains to “the set of responses in which we agree”. This forms the basis of the communitarian conception because somebody will be said to share our form of life in this sense only if they tend to agree in how we follow rules. When this narrow sense is presupposed, the Crusoe and other cases cannot be accommodated because they do not share our responses. But, Chomsky maintains, there is a broader notion of form of life that is based on “the highly species-specific constraints that lead a child to project, on the basis of exposure to a limited corpus of sentences, a variety of new situations”. And when the notion is understood in this broader sense, Crusoe and the other cases can be accommodated because the individuals can be held to share in our form of life as members of the same species.

But, Chomsky continues, a major consequence of this modification of the Wittgensteinian framework to accommodate these cases is that the private language argument is “defanged” because numerous cases of private rule-following will have been allowed.

Therefore we have the following horn: either Wittgenstein’s framework is implausible because it excludes numerous legitimate cases of rule-following (including the Crusoe case); or it can be rendered plausible by expanding the framework to include these cases, but then the impossibility of private language cannot be held to follow from it.

One obvious response is to look at the apparent counterexamples and consider whether they are genuine instances of rule-following. Chomsky's discussion of the Crusoe case is based on placing it in the same category as what he calls standard cases. However,  there is a clear difference between them. All of the more mundane cases involve groups of individuals and communities that are rule-followers despite having responses different to ours. Crusoe differs from us in the more radical sense of not sharing our responses but also not belonging to any community. 

When discussing the Crusoe case, Chomsky explains his status as a rule-follower in terms of different states of his language faculty.

> In our terms, we assume that \[Crusoe] has a language faculty that shares with ours the state S0 and attains a state SL different from ours, on the basis of which we can develop an account for his current perceptions and actions.

Crusoe’s linguistic competence or status as a rule-follower is explained by the transition from the natural initial state of the language faculty to the mature state in which he follows rules, which is mediated by the experience he happens to have. But now the familiar questions can be asked concerning the legitimacy of ascribing rule-following to him.

We can ask the same questions about the rules Crusoe follows as we can ask about any individual. And the appeal to states of the language faculty is not sufficient in this response, any more than they are in relation to an individual who is a full-fledged member of a community.

The appeal to states of the language faculty does not enable Chomsky to distinguish the grasp of deviant rules form the grasp of standard rules. Chomsky suggests this does not create a problem for him. When discussing the cases of communities that differ from us in how they follow rules, he states that “there is no question of ‘correctness’ any more than in the choice between English or French”

He also states that the rules of a person’s language

> entail nothing about what Jones \[the user of the language] ought to do (perhaps he should not observe the rules for one reason or another; they would still be his rules). And the question of the norm in some community is irrelevant for reasons already discussed.


This suggests the rather strange position that the notions of correctness or incorrectness are not relevant to how a person applies a word or rule. If someone grasped a deviant rule that leads him to diverge from us in his use of words and construction of sentences, we should not say that he has done something incorrect and the fact that the community disapproves of his divergent behavior is irrelevant. These passages could also be interpreted as expressing Chomsky's radical individual, that there are correct and incorrect ways of using words, but they derive solely from the individual’s language faculty and the rules he employs. They do not derive from the community.

In other words, we do not have to call the individual who diverges from us in his use of language incorrect as long as what they are doing accords with the rule that the individual has grasped, or with the way in which they happen to have parameterised the grammatical principles.

This view, though, is reduced to absurdity by Wittgenstein’s gerrymandering argument. If anything anybody does in using a word, constructing a sentence, etc., can be justified by appealing to some privately grasped rule or deviant way of setting the parameters, then the whole notion of correctness and incorrectness dissolves.

Furthermore, this negative argument can be appealed to in response to any of the counterexamples to the communitarian conception. Any such counterexample would, it seems, have to presuppose the notion of logical compulsion, thus leaving it vulnerable. Ultimately, then, it is Chomsky’s reliance upon this notion that weakens his attempted defence of the “individual psychology” standpoint of his linguistics.

# Conclusion
---
It would be too hasty to conclude that Chomsky’s project is undermined by Wittgenstein’s arguments because there is more that needs to be explored both in relation to the interpretation of these arguments and the details of Chomsky’s linguistics.

Articulating what the Wittgensteinian challenge would amount to when certain of his arguments are interpreted in a particular way (i.e. as targeting the notion of logical compulsion). However, a full defense of this interpretation requires more discussion.

The interesting thing about Chomsky’s exchange with Wittgenstein and Kripke is that it allows us to engage concretely with the question of whether a research project such as his could be undermined on philosophical grounds, i.e. whether it must consider and respond to objections very different to those generated from empirical research into language use and language acquisition.

There are further issues that haven't been described here. For example, since the publication of Kripke’s reading of Wittgenstein, there has been considerable debate concerning the issue of “semantic normativity”. The issue has to do with whether the meaning of a word – that which we grasp when we understand it – entails obligations for how that word ought to be applied in particular instances, obligations moreover that are intrinsically semantic and not reducible to other kinds of norms. Wittgenstein’s discussion of meaning and Chomsky’s response both appear to implicitly engage with this issue. 

The notion of semantic normativity seems to be closely connected with that of logical compulsion because the latter involves the pattern of correct application of a word being determined in accordance with its meaning (that which we grasp “in a flash”) and being compelled to apply it in accordance with how it is so determined. On the other hand, as discussed previously, part of Chomsky’s response to Wittgenstein is to argue that the rules of a person’s language “entail nothing about what the person ought to do”

Therefore, if there is this close connection – or perhaps even equivalence – between the notions of semantic normativity and logical compulsion, it may turn out that Wittgenstein and Chomsky are actually in agreement in their opposition to these notions.

Chomsky would face the challenge of characterising his conception of linguistic competence without relying on a notion such as logical compulsion. This is not a problem that Wittgenstein would face because he is not engaged in anything like the explanatory project of Chomskyan linguistics. Therefore, if we were to pursue the possibility that they are both opposed to the notion of logical compulsion, there would nevertheless be significant disagreement between them on other central points.
