## Kripke-Style Possible Worlds Semantics
---
Possible worlds semanticists apply [[Necessity and Possibility|modal logic]] to natural language. The initial aim of these systems was to introduce a $\Box$ operator into languages of the predicate calculus with roughly the meaning "it is a logical/analytic/necessary truth that".

Apart from the persistent problem of interpretation,*What is this notion of logical/analytic/necessary truth that is to be captured?*, the underlying technical ideas are clear. Since modal operators express operators defined in terms of truth at *model-like* elements, *models* for modal languages must contain such elements, typically called "possible worlds".

These are the elements relative to which quantifiers have domains, expressions have extensions, and sentences have truth values. A model for a modal language $L_M$ consists of the [[Necessity and Possibility|following]].

Although S5 is the most popular system, the case for it is vexed. One factor that should have no weight is terminological. If one thinks of the "worlds" in a model as "possible," then some "worlds" posited by K, M, B, and S4 are *impossible* relative to the actual world. But surely one might think there can't be any impossible worlds. Similarly, if one starts with the idea that members of W are *possible*, then R, which is often called the accessibility relation, will seem mysterious. If all worlds are possible, what does it mean to say that only some are "accessible"? Without a plausible answer, R may appear to be a mere technical artifact, to be dispensed with in any real logic of necessity; hence S5.

This reasoning is flawed. The fact that something in a logical model is called a "world", doesn't mean that it is a concrete entity like our universe existing in a pluriverse of alternative realities. It is enough that it be something relative to which sentences and other expressions are evaluated, a maximally complete and informative property that represents the universe as being a certain way.

The actual world-state is the maximal world representing property that is instantiated; a possible world-state is one that could have been instantiated.

For relative possibility, there will be states $w_0, w_1$ and $w_2$ such that $w_1$ but not $w_2$ is possible relative to $w_0$. There is nothing incoherent in the idea that relative possibility may not be transitive.

The question of what modal system to adopt is inseparable form the question of what we want '$\Box$' to capture.

Quine's objection to quantifying in modal systems for logical necessity can be phrased as follows. Noting that *logical truth* and *[[Kinds of Truths|analyticity]]* are standardly taken to be properties of sentences, he likened quantification in contexts governed by such operators the following quantification:

1. $\forall x$ "if x is a cat, x is an animal" is an analytic/logical truth.

Quine was right to be dubious. It's not that one can't make quantification into quotes intelligible. One can, as Kaplan shows. However, the resulting notion of *de re* logical truth is of little theoretical interest and of no interest in capturing any commonsense notion of necessity. The chief interest in quantified modal logic lies with metaphysical necessity, essentialism, and nontrivial model *de re* of Kripke.

There's a bunch of other stuff but it seems literally unintelligible to me LOL.
