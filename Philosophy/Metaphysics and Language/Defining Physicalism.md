## Introduction
---
There is little agreement on what physicalism is. There is dispute regarding  whether physicalist views must deny the existence of irreducible mentality, whether physicalism's status as the historical successor to materialism entails Hobbes was a physicalist in the same sense as David Lewis, etc.

Although there appears to be a consensus outside those who discuss the issue that physicalism is incompatible with the existence of irreducible mentality and that physicalists believe that what exists is in some way what is countenanced by physics, as we will see, this orthodoxy faces an important puzzle now frequently referred to as ‘Hempel's Dilemma’.

## History
---
Physicalism is often held to be the historical successor of materialism. Materialism, in its Enlightenment heyday, was a position held in contrast to the dualism of Descartes and the idealism of Berkeley. It was a view about substance, the view that the only kind of substance is material substance.

Material substance was held by all parties to possess a nature very different from other conceivable substances (in particular, mental substance). Philosophers tend to take their views about the nature of material substance from the science of the day. For example, Descartes took material substance of be essentially extended. Locke took material substance to be essentially that which had the primary qualities of solidity, extension, shape, motion or rest, and number.

As science progressed, it chipped away at the concept of matter with which Locke and others were working. For example, Bohr's theory of the atom as a tiny, dense nucleus surrounded by mostly empty space challenged the idea that every material substance was solid. The discovery of electrons and other point particles suggested that matter was not essentially extended.

You can either take this show that matter has different nature than was earlier thought, or you could reasonably conclude that there is no matter. If one continued, like the materialists, to take the discoveries of science to have ontological significance, these discoveries forced on to countenance the existence of other kinds of entities that even more so failed to accord with earlier conceptions of matter (electromagnetic fields, space-time) however much of its essential features were dropped.

By the early twentieth century, philosophers who continued to take the developing science to be guide to the nature of reality could no longer say that the only kind of substance was matter. However, the response wasn't to develop a new list of necessary features that the substances described by physical science exhibited. Rather, the view that everything was material involved into the more accommodating view that everything is physical, where physical substances were not taken to have any antecedently specified, necessary features.

However physical science says the world and substances are, that is how they are. As Lewis put it. "Materialist metaphysicians want to side with physics, but not to take sides within physics". Still, physicalists preserved the earlier disagreement with dualists and idealists who believed in the existence of distinct mental entities not reducible to physical entities.

This is only one story of the history of physicalism, although physicalism since the ~50s, has been generally understood this way, the first philosophers calling themselves 'physicalists' did not understand their position in this way as continuing the legacy of materialism. The logical positivists, including Carnap, thought materialism was as problematic as idealism and dualism.

Feigl distills Carnap's version of physicalism into two theses.
1. The language of science is unified: in particular, all scientific claims can meet a standard of intersubjective confirmability, exhibited for example, by the language of physics.
2. the facts and laws of the natural and the social sciences can be derived as least in principle from the theoretical assumptions of physics.

What was most important to these physicalists was that scientific claims be subject to empirical test and confirmed by intersubjective agreement. Not the elimination of all mental entities.

It's possible to trace contemporary disagreements regarding the correct definition of physicalism to these different ways of seeing the twentieth century shift from materialism to physicalism.

Is physicalism essentially a twentieth-to-twenty-first-century manifestation of materialism, a view which rules out Cartesian mental substances, fundamental consciousness, etc? Or is it instead a view intended to avoid or discard the ontological baggage of materialism?

## Hempel's Dilemma
---
However we answer these questions, many interpret physicalism as the doctrine that everything is physical, where to be *physical* is to be countenanced by physics. In other words, physicalism is the view that the world contains just those types of things that physics says it contains.

There are two main interpretational issues.
1. There is the issue that this formulation looks immediately to entail an implausible eliminativism about a lot of things it shouldn't. For example, physics very likely won't talk about mothers, baseballs, etc. So one might think that physicalism cannot be the view that the world contains *just* what physics says it contains. The crux of this issue is whether one thinks that physicalism must be reductive, i.e., whether the physicalist must believe that even though physics textbooks do not use words like 'mother', 'baseball', etc the referents of these terms are just collections of electrons and quarks, and so on, i.e. the sort of things that physics does talk about. If physicalism must be reductive, then the rough formulation can stand. Otherwise, physicalism will be the doctrine that the world contains just the types of things physics says it contains *and whatever else bears a sufficiently tight metaphysical relation (e.g. supervenience, constitution, realization) to the types of entities physics mentions*.
2. The second issue concerns what is meant by 'physics' and 'physical' in the rough formulation. It is here that some have argued that those seeking to define physicalism face a problem, one that Hempel noted years ago about the logical positivist's formulation of the position:

> The physicalistic claim that the language of physics can serve as a unitary language of science is inherently obscure: The language of _what_ physics is meant? Surely not that of, say, 18th century physics; for it contains terms like ‘caloric fluid’, whose use is governed by theoretical assumptions now thought false. Nor can the language of contemporary physics claim the role of unitary language, since it will no doubt undergo further changes, too. The thesis of physicalism would seem to require a language in which a _true_ theory of all physical phenomena can be formulated. But it is quite unclear what is to be understood here by a physical phenomenon.

This problem is referred to as Hempel's Dilemma. When the physicalist says that the world contains just what physics says it contains, does she mean what *current physics* says it contains or what some *future, ideal or completed physics* will say it contains?

If physicalism is the view that the world contains just what current physics says it contains, then surely physicalism is false. All previously defended physical theories have been shown to be false by further scientific experiment and progress, so we have good reason to think the current physics is also false. Since physics is surely wrong in some respects, it's false that the world only contains what this false theory says it contains. Even if you reject pessimistic meta-inductions, there is a simpler way to see that physicalism defined in terms of current physics is false. It's often pointed out that current physics is inconsistent. It makes incompatible predictions. Therefore, the world is not the way current physics says it is. Therefore, physicalism on a current physics interpretation is false. This is the first horn of Hempel's Dilemma.

Problems arise if physical is defined as the view that the world contains just what some future, ideal, or completed physics will say it contains:
1. Physicalism defined in this futurist way fails because it leaves physicalism with a content that is vague or indeterminate. Who knows what future physics will posit? So, who knows what it would be for the world to contain what that future, currently unknown theory would contain? 
2. A second worry is that such futurist formulations make physicalism a trivial doctrine. Since in order to become complete, physics will of course expand as much as it has to in order to explain all phenomena, it is trivially true that the world contains just what a true, completed physics says it contains. 
3. Another worry is that if physicalism is defined in terms of future, completed physics, physicalism might be true in epistemically possible scenarios in which it is intuitively false. For example, suppose physicists in the end posit fundamental mental entities as part of the true, final theory. Many philosophers have the intuition that this would be a situation in which physicalism has been shown false. But if physicalism is the view that the world contains just what a future completed physics says it contains, then this is a scenario in compatible with the truth of physicalism.
This is the second horn of Hempel's Dilemma.

We will go over a few prominent positions that being by accepting the consequences Hempel's Dilemma
## Accepting Hempel's Dilemma
---
### 'There is no question of Physicalism'
Tim Crane and D.H. Mellor argue that physicalism is 'the wrong answer to an essentially trivial question'. They are concerned with the second horn of Hempel's Dilemma, considering what if anything could be meant by the claim that the world contains just what a completed physics says it contains. They consider several more ways of understanding physicalism and come to this conclusion: If physicalism is anything other than a trivial position, it is false. If physicalism is anything other than false, it is trivial. Philosophers should stop engaging in debates about the relationship between the physical and everything else.

### Physicalism as a stance or attitude
In a less pessimistic move, Bas van Fraassen have argued that it's wrong to think of physicalism as a doctrine, i.e., a contentful claim that may be taken as true or false. Rather, physicalism should be viewed as a stance on takes toward the world. Alyssa Ney develops a proposal similar to this position arguing that physicalism is a specific attitude one takes towards forming one's ontological commitments. One is a physicalist in so far as one is disposed to believe in all and only those entities which (current) physics says exists. This understanding of physicalism avoids Hempel's Dilemma since physicalism so construed is not the type of thing to be true, false, or trivial. Instead, like other stances or attitudes, it may be justified or not justified.

### A Priori Formulations
Alternatively, one might conclude from the dilemma that although attempts to define physicalism in terms of physics are hopeless, this does not mean that physicalism in any form is hopeless, or that it is not doctrine. Rather, one might think that one must find some other way to understand physicalism as the doctrine that everything is physical, one that does not understand 'physical' in terms of physics.

Such strategies have a kinship with early materialist attempts to flesh out the essence of matter in an a priori way. At least two such strategies have been pursued in the literature:
1. Ned Markosian has suggested that 'physical' just means located in space-time, and hence that physicalism is the doctrine that everything is located in space-time. In a similar vein, Grover Maxwell held that physical properties are the non-logical properties of space-time.
2. A more popular strategy is what is often called the *via negativa* or non-mentalism. Barbara Montero, David Papineau, and David Spurrett have argued that 'physical' just means non-(fundamentally) mental. Of course, it's compatible with this conception of physicalism that individuals have mental properties, but these will not be fundamental features of these entities.

We call these formulations of physicalism a priori because they do not tie what is physical to what is discovered by science, but rather to some features that match our intuitions about what physical entities are.

Whichever of the three above strategies one takes in understanding physicalism, accepting the conclusion of Hempel's Dilemma involves giving up on something, whether it be that physicalism is a contentful doctrine or that it in some way ties our ontological commitments solely to what is discovered by physical science. Thus, it is worth considering whether the two horns of the dilemma are indeed as vicious as one might have at first thought.

## Responses to Hempel's Dilemma
---
### Embracing the First Horn: Currentism
Andrew Melnyk is the only philosopher (to the authors knowledge) that has embraced the first horn of Hempel's Dilemma. Melnyk claims that physicalism is the doctrine that the world contains just what current physics says it contains. He then accepts the consequence that this means physicalism is false. However, he argues that this is not as problematic as many take it to be. Melnyk argues that physicalism is an empirical, contingent doctrine and should be treated the same way a scientific realist treats any other currently accepted scientific position.

We may endorse it even though we believe that it is likely to be false so long as it is more probable than any of its formulated rivals. In short, Melnyk denies that it's a constraint on a definition of physicalism that it does not entail the position to be surely false. What we need is a version of physicalism we can accept, not one that we are confident is not false. He then argues that physicalism is more probable than its formulated rivals.

### Embracing the Second Horn: Futurism
Probably the most popular view regarding the correct formulation of physicalism is futurism. Instead of embracing the unintuitive alleged consequences of this definition, futurists try to explain these consequences away or add to their statements of the physicalist position in such a way as to avoid them.

Recall the three putative problems with the futurist strategy:
1. It entails that physicalism is countless.
2. It entails that physicalism is trivial.
3. It gets the wrong results in some epistemically possible scenarios.

In order to avoid the consequence that physicalism defined in terms of future physics has no content, the best strategy for the futurist is to be more precise about what she means by 'physics'. Loewer takes this to be a theory of the fundamental entities. Poland similarly describes it as a theory of the basic class of objects that suffice to give an account of all occupants of space-time. Dowell provides a more comprehensive account of what physics is. She starts by outlining the hallmarks of a scientific theory as one with four features:
1. The inclusion of a set of explanatory hypotheses from which empirically testable implications can be derived.
2. Confirmation by the obtaining of a number and variety of the test-implications of its explanatory hypothesis.
3. The provision of a unified explanation of a variety of empirical generalizations.
4. Additional empirical support by its fit with what is antecedently known and independently observable.

Then, a physical theory is a scientific theory of the world's most fundamental elements.

Once one has a better sense of what a completed physics might look like (rather than conceiving it in purely general terms, as just a theory of everything), it is argued that physicalism defined in terms of completed physics is neither a contentless doctrine nor one that is trivially true.

Dowell says that this ‘requires at least minimally that we can identify some ways the world could turn out or could have turned out such that physicalism on that formulation is false’ (‘Physical Empirical’ 29). Her view has content because there exist clear conditions under which it is true and conditions under which it is false.

The view is not trivially true because there is a conceivable way in which it might turn out to be false. Given Dowell's understanding of physics, physicalism would be false roughly if there were entities that could not be accounted for in any unified scientific theory of the kind that discusses the world's most fundamental elements and meets conditions 1 to 4 above.

All futurists seem to agree that defining physicalism by reference to the nature of fundamental scientific theories is the correct way to get around the first and second pernicious consequences of the second horn of Hempel's Dilemma. Yet there seems to be a stalemate about how to get around the third problem for futurism.

If physicalism is to be viewed as the modern manifestation of materialism, then physicalism must be incompatible with the existence of irreducible mental entities. This is clearly the position of those who take the via negativa strategy described above. This is also the position of others, most prominently Jessica Wilson who argues that the futurist formulation of physicalism needs to be supplemented with what she calls the *No Fundamental Mentality (NFM)* constraint: that an entity is physical only if it is not fundamentally mental.

In contrast, there are other philosophers who argue against incorporating the NFM constraint into a formulation of physicalism. Dowell (‘Physical Empirical’) has argued that we need to more carefully consider the possibility of physicists introducing reference to irreducible mental entities into their theories.

Dowell's diagnosis of the mistaken thought that we need to add something like an NFM constraint to formulations of physicalism is that Wilson and others have mistaken an posteriori fact about the physical for an a priori one (45). It is an a posteriori fact (if it is a fact at all) that physical science will not posit irreducible mentality. But it is not an a priori fact, because it isn't the case that there is no way the world could turn out such that physics comes to posit irreducible mental entities. Thus, the NFM constraint shouldn't be built into our formulation of physicalism.

Ultimately, it is not clear how to settle the disagreement regarding the proper way for the futurist to respond to the second horn of Hempel's Dilemma. Indeed, Chalmers has suggested that the issue may be terminological. In any event, there appears to be two possible ways of embracing the second horn of Hempel's Dilemma.

## Constraints on Definitions of Physicalism
---
I have now sketched six broad responses one might make to Hempel's Dilemma. These amount to five ways of defining physicalism:
- Taking physicalism to be a stance one takes to forming ontological commitments as opposed to a comprehensive thesis about the way the world is.
- Eliminating physicalism's commitment to physics in favor of a priori strictures on what the world contains. For example, one might define physicalism as the view that there is no fundamental mentality (the _via negativa_).
- Taking physicalism to be the thesis that the world contains just what current physics says it contains (currentism).
- Taking physicalism to be the thesis that the world contains just what future, ideal or completed physics says it contains (futurism).
- Taking physicalism to be the joint thesis that (a) the world is the way some physics (current or future) says it is, and (b) there are no irreducible mental entities.
