## Strong Nomism: The Dretske-Armstrong-Tooley (DAT)  Theory of Laws
---
>[!thesis] Strong Nomism
>The view that truths about the laws of nature are metaphysically fundamental, consisting in a primitive, unanalyzable relation of "necessitation" holding between two or more properties or universals.

According to Strong Nomism, the laws of nature determine which counterfactual conditionals are true, and they also determine which powers and tendencies particular things have. 

For example, if it is a law of nature that whenever an F encounters a G in relation R, the G becomes H, then we can say that the law of nature confers a corresponding active power on all F's and a corresponding passive power on al G's. If it is a law of nature that all F's become H's within a certain span of time, then the law confers on all F's the immanent power of making themselves H's within that span of time.

Probabilistic and oaken laws can be thought of as conferring tendencies of the appropriate kind. It seems that laws can indeed ground the truth of both conditionals and the attributions of power.

Are the laws grounded in truths about powers or vice versa? If the laws are fundamental, with the powers of particular things grounded in them, how exactly is this supposed to work? What is the logical form of the laws of nature, from which we are supposed to be able to derive the attributions of powers to particular things.

One option has the laws of nature directly state that certain kinds of things have certain powers and tendencies, on this view we can derive the attribution of powers and tendencies to such things from those laws, but it seems like laws of such a kind would be made true by particular attributions. If it were a law that all fire had the power to burn wood, what makes it true is that all fire has this power, the universal generalization is made true by its instances or by the absence of counterexamples.

A second option, suppose the laws of nature merely say that all instances of fire's being brought into proximity to wood are followed in time by the burning of the wood. This is logically independent of the attribution of any power to the fire, so the law of nature could be independent of and prior to the particular attributions. However, now we cannot deduce that fire has the power to burn wood from the law. The law merely says that the placing of fire nad wood in proximity to one another is followed by the wood's being burned. It says nothing about any instance of fire's having the power to burn the wood.

Dretske, Armstrong, and Tooley adopt a third option concerning the logical form of laws of nature. A law of nature attributes a special kind of relation, nomic necessitation, to an ensemble of properties or universals. This view is the most prominent and plausible Strong Nomist position in the literature.

Return to the fire and wood case. The supposed law of nature would state that the nomic-necessitation relation holds between the following pair of complex properties:
1. Being some wood brought into proximity to some fire.
2. Being some wood that is burned.

This leaves it mysterious how we're supposed to derive any information about particular cases of fire and wood from the fact that this supposed relation holds between the two properties.

Strong Nomists must simply posit a brute necessity between the holding of a law and the corresponding universal generalization. We should prefer a theory with fewer ad hoc postulations of necessities. Where necessities must be posited, we should prefer theories that derive the necessity from the essential structure of the things involved. Nomism offers no such explanation of the necessary connection between laws and generalizations, so this must be counted as a cost of the theory.

The main compensating advantage is that Nomism provides a metaphysical explanation of the difference between lawful and accidental generalization. Lawful generalizations correspond to a relation of nomic necessitation connecting the relevant properties, while accidental generalizations have no such counterpart. This advantage isn't unique to Nomism, a strong powerist account can make a similar distinction between generalizations that are supported by powers and those that are not.

A key question for Nomism: is the relation of nomic necessitation an internal relation among properties involved? Where R is an internal relation if and only if necessarily, for every x and y, whether R holds between x and y depends only on the intrinsic properties of x and y.

The Nomist must count the nomic relation as non-internal. If it were internal, then, assuming that properties have their intrinsic features essentially, the properties involved would have active and passive powers in their very natures. Thus, powers would be among the fundamental features of the world. This would fit the Strong Powerist picture, not with the Strong Nomist picture.

If the nomic relation is not an internal relation, is it contingent or necessary? If it's necessary, then it holding with necessity in each case would seem to be a brute necessity. If it's contingent, its holding contingently would be something for which there could be no further explanation. It would be a brute contingency.

We should minimize the brute external relations posited by a theory as a principle of theory choice?

Nomism suffers from four defects:
1. Nomism must posit an additional, irreducible relation of nomic necessitation between properties.
2. Nomism must posit that whenever the nomic-necessitation relation holds between two properties, its holding between them is a brute, inexplicable, and uncaused fact.
3. As a consequence of 1, Nomism must treat properties as real entities, capable of entering into relations.
4. Nomism must posit a brute necessary between each law of nature and the corresponding generalization, whether universal or statistical.

There are three additional objections to be lodged again Nomism:
5. There are a variety of logical forms that laws of nature can take. Few have the simple form of a universal generalization involving just two universals like (x)(Fx -> Gx).

Laws might involve disjunctions or conjunctions like (1) and (2):
1. (x)((Fx & Gx) -> Hx)
2. (x)(Fx -> (Hx or Jx))

As Tooley recognized, Nomists need a distinct necessitation relation for each logical form. In the simple case, we have one relation, N1, holding between F and G entailing (x)(Fx -> Gx). In the case of laws (1) and (2) we would need two additional necessitation relations N2 and N3, N2 holding between F, G, and H and entailing (1), and N3 holding between F, H, and J and entailing (2). If there are a large number of laws with a wide variety of logical forms, Nomism could be saddled with positing a large number of distinct necessitation relations.

6. Nomism must explain why we tend to accept simple scientific laws of nature. Whenever we find the data fitting to a simple pattern we come to be quite confident that the data are to be explained by a correspondingly simple law of nature. We believe that gravitational force varies inversely with the square of the distance, not with the distance to the power 2.0000000000000001, for example. This preference for simple laws is hard to explain on Nomism. What reason would we have for thinking that the nomic necessitation relation is more likely to hold between two simple properties than between to complex ones. The Neo-Humeist has a neat explanation of the fact.

The nomist could posit that it's simply a basic, inexplicable principle of rationality that we should always prefer the theory with the simplest law, but this would be a further cost of the theory, since all being equal we should prefer the theory that posits the fewest primitive, underivable postulates of reason.

7. Consider functional laws that relate two or more quantities. An example would be Newton's force laws, $F=ma$. When a force of quantity x Newtons is applied to a mass of q kilograms, the mass accelerates at a rate of x/q meters per second per second. The values of F or m can be any real number from 0 to infinity. Thus, there are an infinite number of property-triples of force, mass, and acceleration, one for each pair of force and mass quantities. On Nomism, the force law $F=ma$ is an infinite collection of laws, each with a fundamental nomic-necessitation connection among a different triple of force, mass, and acceleration quantities. This is a huge inflation of the Nomist ontology.

In addition, many Nomists want to deny the existence of uninstantiated universals. However, it seems likely that there are many specific quantities of mass, force, and acceleration that are never instantiated in the actual world. These possible quantities would seem to be things that would necessarily obey the relevant functional alws, but the Nomist cannot explain this, since the "missing" universals cannot bear the nomological necessity relation in virtue of the fact that they do not exist.

We could describe the debate between Strong Nomists and Strong Powerists in this way: Nomists believe in the relation of nomic necessitation, which consists in the possession of certain powers on the part of universals. When universal U1 is tied by nomic necessitation to U2, the relation of nomic necessitation conerns on universal U1 the active power of making its instances be instances of U2, while conferring the complmentary passive power to U2. In contrat, Powerists believe that the fundamental powers are possessed by ordinary particulars, not universals.

# Neo-Humeism: Reduction of Conditionals, Laws, and Powers
---
>[!thesis] Neo-Humeist
>All truths or supposed truths about powers, counterfactuals, and laws of nature are grounded in and reducible to truths about the actual distribution of ordinary, qualitative properties in space and time.

The neo-humeist program proceeds in the following way:
1. Give a reductionist account of the laws of nature.
2. Use the laws of nature to ground the truths of attributions of power and of counterfactual conditionals.

The key problem for the Neo-Humeist program is to account for the difference between lawful generalizations and mere accidental generalizations.. The Ramsey/Lewis theory proposes the difference between the two depends on the way in which a generalization does or does not fit into our best scientific theory of the world.

By "best" scientific theory, we mean the theory that combines the most "virtues", where the standards of theoretical virtue are fixed by the contentions and customs of our actual scientific practice (need this be the case for Neo-Humeism?).

Particularly, we seem to value two things in our theories:
1. [[Systematizing the theoretical virtues#Evidential Theoretical Virtues|Good fit]] between the theory's predictions and observed experimental results.
2. [[Systematizing the theoretical virtues#Aesthetic Theoretical Virtues|Overall simplicity]] of the theory in terms of its basic vocabulary, fundamental postulates, and mathematical form.

We should be willing to accept some discrepancy between the theory and the data if the theory is much simpler than its more accurate competitors, and we should be willing to accept a relatively complex theory if its predictions are much better than any simpler one. The "best" theory is the one that achieves the best trade-off between these two values.

This account has two principal advantages:
1. It's ontologically very simple. It posits no fundamental truths involving powers, laws, or counterfactuals.
2. It has a simple explanation for our preference for simple scientific theories. A simple account of the laws is more likely to be true, since to be a law is nothing more than to be a generalization that belongs to the simplest account of nature. A simpler theory is more likely to be "true" because simplicity is one of the two factors that make theories true.\

There are three major objections:
1. It makes the laws of nature dependent on us, on our practices and preferences, in a way incompatible with scientific realism.
2. It makes the powers of things extrinsic to those things, facing counterexamples involving hypothetical "small worlds".
3. It has difficulty explaining the rationality of induction.

## Argument from Scientific Realism
---
What makes something a law of nature is that it would fit into a theory that would best satisfy our preferences, as fixed by actual scientific practices.

This seems to make scientific reality relative to the contingencies of our conventional perspective. Scientific truth is no longer objective and mind-independent. 

The Neo-Humeist response is as follows. One can "rigidify" the reference to our practices and preferences, so it is our practices and preferences in this, the actual world, that fixes the meaning of 'law'. This rigidification makes the laws of nature independent of us, in the sense that the laws would have been the same, even if our practices and preferences were different. A similar rigidification could take place with respect to time.

This rigidification comes at a steep cost, it would follow from this account that we may not be reliable in identifying the laws of nature. Our conventions and preferences could have been different, and had they been different, we would have systematically misidentified the laws of nature. That we here an now get the laws right is just a lucky accident.
