There are particular things, and there are the properties those things have and relations those things bear to one another.

We can distinguish between particulars and properties, with particulars instantiating or exemplifying properties or we can speak of properties as predicated of or characterizing particulars.

There is substantial controversy about the nature of both particulars and properties. This controversy is sometimes called *"the problem of universals"* or *"the problem of the one over many"*. 

Some thinks that the categories of particular and property are fundamental, some of the things in both are in no way derived from or dependent on things in another category. These philosophers are *realists* about both particulars and properties.

*Nominalists* and *conceptualists* think of particulars as fundamental and of properties as non-fundamental, with the latter derived from the former.

*Bundle Realists* think the dependence runs the other way: they agree with Realists that some properties are fundamental, but disagree with both Realists and Nominalists in thinking that particulars are derived from properties. Particulars are simply "bundles" of properties on this view.

Here we'll note two facts of near-universal agreement.
1. Very many properties are *shareable*: more than one thing can exemplify one and the same property. There is controversy about the exact nature of this sharing, but that there is sharing isn't controversial.
2. There is some connection between something's satisfying a linguistic predicate and it exemplifying a property. Generally, something x satisfies a predicate P if and only if when one combines a name or specifying description for x with P in a grammatically appropriate way, one produces a true sentence.

# What properties must explain
---
The primary datum a theory of properties must explain is the simple fact that many things are similar to one another in certain respects.

Consider three things, the first of which is red and square, the second of which is red and circular, and the third of which is blue and circular. The Red Square and the Red Circle are similar in color. They are dissimilar in shape. The Red Circle and the Blue Circle are similar in shape but dissimilar in color. The Red Square and Blue Circle as dissimilar both in color and shape.

What we see here is similarity in certain respects (e.g., color, shape, etc.) and sharing of properties (e.g., *redness*, *circularity*, etc.).

Facts of similarity aren't the only bits of data a theory of properties must explain. A theory of properties must also account for the relations among properties, so-called categorical relations. For example, the property of being red and the property of being colored are related in that being red is a way of being colored. The property of being colored is a *determinable* of the property of being red, and the latter is a *determinate* of the former.

A different type of categorical relation obtains between other properties. Take the property of being red and the property of being blue, these are related in that nothing can have both at once. We might say that being red precludes being blue. Such categorical relations seem to be necessary. Given the existence of these properties, they simply must stand in these categorical relations. It's important to consider how it is that various theories of properties fare explaining the necessity of these categorical relations.

Closely related to categorical relations are the predications of other properties and relations to properties. For example, the property of having 1 kg of mass or the property of being red seems more similar or closer to having the property of having 3 kg of mass or being orange than it is to having 10 kg of mass or being blue. These relations of relative similarity and difference among properties suggest that there must be properties to serve as the relata of these relations.

Finally, there are two other phenomena that properties have been employed to explain: the possibility of intentionality in both language and thought, and the distribution of causal powers and dispositions.

Intentionality concerns the aboutness of language and thought: how it is, when we predicate some property of some entity, that our though succeeds *in being about* that property.

# Realism
---
The first cluster of views about the nature of properties we'll consider is Realism. Realism has two characteristic features.
1. Realist views maintain that (at least some) properties ground the character of ordinary objects like rocks and tables and dogs.
2. Realist views maintain that properties are universals.

What exactly is it to think that properties ground the character of ordinary objects? Essentially, it is that ordinary objects have the character they do *in virtue of* the properties they exemplify. This is extra-conceptual grounding, a grounding relation between entities or facts in the world.

What exactly is it to think that properties are universals? Essentially, it is that properties are just as fundamental as the things that have them, in the sense that they are not derived from or dependent on those things. This feature could use clarification, since it's common to define universals as properties that can exemplified by more than one thing. This characterization is inadequate to fully account for the differences between believing in universals and not. To see this, suppose that one identifies properties with classes. Two versions of Nominalism make just this identification between properties and classes. If you insist that universals are just properties that could be exemplified by more than one thing, Class and Resemblance Nominalism turn out to be committed to universals. Properties are classes, exemplification is class membership, and some property-classes will have more than one object in them. Thus, some properties are capable of being exemplified by more than one object, and that's just to say that there are universals. This would be fine except that Nominalism is often taken to be the view that there are no universals.

A second issue is that it precludes taking haecceities to be universals. One ought not foreclose this possibility at the outset. To fix these problems, we should think of universals as fundamental character-grounders.

# Troubles for Realism
---
We are in the game of constructing a theory to explain a certain data set, and the process of choosing a theory is more than simply considering whether a view can explain the data. Many views can explain the set of data. We must consider a theory's strengths and its weaknesses to evaluate whether it best explains the relevant data.

*The Universal-Particular Distinction*. The first challenge a Realist faces can be put in the form of a question: What is the distinction between universals and particulars? Realists must commit to the following principles:
- *Aristotelian UP*. Universals can be predicated of other things, while particulars cannot be predicated of anything.
- *Russellian UP.* Particulars are necessarily located in only one place at a time, while universals can be wholly present at many places at once.
- *Wise UP.* Any particular can coexist with another particular indiscernible from it, but it's impossible for any universal to be indiscernible from anything else.

Take Aristotelian UP first. Advocates of this view tend to start with the observation that predicates in natural languages "correspond" to universals. In at least a certain class of cases, something satisfies a predicate if and only if it exemplifies the universal that corresponds to that predicate. The thought goes: predicates in language are attached to subjects in a language via concatenation, and in an analogous way universals are "attached" to particulars via "ontic" predication.

Frank Ramsey powerfully argued that the notion of ontic *predication* cannot be made sense of without presupposing a distinction between universals and particulars. Therefore, one cannot use predication as a basis for making that distinction. Instead, the distinction must be the basis for understanding predication. Even if one could understand predication independently of the universal-particular distinction, Ramsey argued that one would not be able to define the direction of predication. The only reason one has for thinking that it is universals, rather than particulars, that are predicated is an arbitrary linguistic distinction between subjects and natural language predicates. But natural language needn't have this sort of structure. Ramsey is thus arguing that the linguistic evidence is simply insufficient to support a robust universal-particular distinction. But the linguistic evidence is all the advocate of Aristotelian UP has to drawn on.
