- Philosophers have argued for ages over the nature of persons and what is involved in the numerical identity of persons over time.
- To under numerical identity, consider the following: The two chairs at the kitchen table, which look exactly alike and are made of the same material, may be qualitatively identical, but they are not numerically identical.
	- Contrast this  with the one chair in my room. If someone paints that chair while my eyes are closed, then the chair you see when you open your eyes will be qualitatively different but numerically the same chair.

**Numerical Identity:** Term used to describe an object being the very same object.

**Qualitative identity:** The object has all the same properties or qualities.

- An object is only numerically identical to itself but can be qualitatively identical to other objects.
- The peristence question of identity is the question about the conditions under which an object remains numerically identical


- Apply this to persons. When a relative tells you that you've changed over the years, he recognizes that you are still numerically the same person but see's you've qualitatively changed.

- How do we determine the numerical identity of someone? We first have to agree on how the concept "person" gets its meaning.
- John Locke stated that the concept "person" is a forensic concept. A public concept because he takes its meaning to be determined by how we use it ([[The Solution and the 'Private Language' Argument|impossibility of private language seems to be of importance here]]), or by how we ought to use it if we want our speaking to be in accordance with out common beliefs, attitudes, and practices.

- Not everyone agree on the meaning of the concept "person" being determined by our common use of it. Parfit contests this assumption. He warns our use of this term may be wrongheaded.

- There are two main philosophical approaches to the questions of what persons are and what makes a person maintain her numerical identity over time: reductionist and nonreductionist approach.
	- There are different versions of reductionism: Constitutive reductionism is likely the most defensible version of reductionism with regard to persons. They admit persons exist but argue they are fully constituted by their physical and/or psychological continuity, and nothing over and above these continuities.

- Constitutive reductionists are metaphysical reductionists, not conceptual reductionists. They claim that persons are not separately existing entities over and above their physical and/or psychological continuity.

- A metaphysical nonreductionist claims that persons are separately existing entities over and above their physical and psychological continuity.
	- An example of such a view would be someone who identifies persons in accordance with their soul and does not take this soul to be fully constituted by any combination of further entities.

- Within constitutive reductionism there is still a division to be made.
	- Some reductionists such as Bernard Williams and Thomas Nagel, argue that a person stays the same person as long as there is a certain degree of physical continuity.
	- Others, such as Sydney Shoemaker and Parfit, hold that a person stays the same as long as their is a certain degree of non-branched psychological continuity.

- Parfit argues for his view by stating we should be either non-reductionist or reductionists, by advancing there is no evidence for the non-reductionist view, and by demonstrating how we can describe psychological continuity in a way that does not presuppose personal identity.

- Two of the premises that could be questioned are premise 6 and 7. Can quasi-memories really be called "memories", or are they only bits of information. If the latter is the case, could quasi-memory then still be said to be an instance of psychological continuity.
- Parfit asks us to imagine a world in which we could have memories of experiencing an event at which we were in fact no present.

### Defining Premises

1. When we ask what persons are, and how they continue to exist, the fundamental choice is between two views: the nonreductionist view and the reductionist view.
2. On the nonreductionist view, persons are separately existing entities distinct from their brain and bodies and their experiences.. On this view, persons are entities whose existence must be all-or-nothing.
3. On the reductionist view, persons exist. And a person is distinct from his brain and body, and his experiences. But persons are not separately existing entities. The existence of a person, during any period, just consists in the existence of his brain and body, the thinking of his thoughts, the doing of his deeds, and the occurrence of many other physical and mental events.

### Arguments in Defense of the Reductionist View
4. The reductionist view is true if
	- (A) If the occurence of psychological continuity does not presuppose that a person holds these psychological events together and
	- (B) If we should reject the belief that persons are separately existing entities.
5. We could think of memories as instantiations of quasi-memories.
6. I would have an "accurate quasi-memory of past experiences if I seem to remember having an experience; someone did have this experience; and my apparent memory is causally dependent on that past experience"
	- An example  of my quasi-memory of another person's past experience could be this: This person experiences something; a memory of this experience is formed; this memory gets stored on some device and is then downloaded to my brain.
7. The continuity of quasi-memory is an instantiation of psychological continuity. That is, If there is continuity of quasi-memory, then there is an Instantiation of psychological continuity. $\forall x P(x) \to Q(x)$.
8. If we were aware that our quasi-memories may be of other people's past experiences, as well as ours, these quasi-memories would and should not be automatically combined with the belief that these memories are about our own experiences. That is, the continuity of quasi-memory ($P$) is consistent with the idea that this continuity can be shared by different persons ($R$).  $\exists x (P(x) \land R(x))$
	1.  A certain continuity of quasi-memory can be shared by different persons ($P(a) \land R(a)$ (existential elimination, 8))
	2. There is continuity of quasi-memory ($P(a)$ (simplification, C1))
	3. The occurrence of a certain continuity of quasi-memory implies the occurrence of a certain psychological continuity ($P(a) \to Q(a)$ (universal elimination, 7))
	4. There is an instantiation of psychological continuity ($Q(a)$ modus ponens, C2, C3)
	5. Something has the property of being shared by different persons ($R(a)$ (simplification, C1))
	6. The property of being psychologically continuous is consistent with the property of being shared: $Q(a) \land R(a)$ (conjunction, C4, C5)
	7. Psychological continuity is consistent with the property of being shared: $\exists x(Q(x) \land R(x))$. In other words, the occurrence of psychological continuity does not presuppose that one person holds these psychological events together,
