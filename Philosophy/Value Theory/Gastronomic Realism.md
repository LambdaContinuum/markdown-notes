*Gastronomic realism* holds that there are various facts about gastronomic value, facts whihc are similarly independent of our beliefs. On the face of it, such a position seems highly implausible. "*De gustibus non disputandum est*".

Surprisingly, many of the arguments have that been used to defend moral realism seem equally well suited for the defense of gastronomic realism. We'll make the case for such a parity of treatment.

If gastronomic realism is just as defensible as moral realism, then perhaps we ought reject moral realism along with it. This argument may form as the basis for a *reductio ad absurdum* against moral realism.

## What is Gastronomic Realism?
---
We've all thought of various foods as simply *better* than others. Not much has been said about the metaphysical status of these claims. What exactly *is* gastronomic realism?

At minimum, it's the view that gastronomic value properties ("GVPs), such as the property of *being an excelent Valpolicella Classico* are real. What it means to be real isn't a question of concern, its counterpart moral realism is compatible with any number of plausible answers.

We need to distinguish GVPs from other less controversial properties in the neighborhood. No one doubts that there are any number of *non-evaluative* facts about how food taste. Similarly, it's uncontroversial that certain foods taste better or worse *to* certain individuals. Likewise, there are perfectly ordinary *social* facts about these matters of taste, facts about broad patterns of intersubjective response to certain types of foods.

## A Presumption in Favor of Gastronomic Realism?
---
*Moral* realists often argue that moral realism should be our starting point, the default view unless decisive objections to it are found. In this spirit, we may ask why gastronomic realism *needs* a defense.

Moral realists often being by pointing to the nature of our *moral experience*. Morality does not *feel* as though its simply a projection to our own minds. On the contrary, the world we observe seems to be full of moral value and disvalue. We speak of it in the declarative mood, as if we mean to be making statements of fact. We think that we might be mistaken about moral questions. These and other features of our moral experience are brought together in support of the claim that this experience has an air of objectivity.

Gastronomic experience is surprisingly similar. Some foods clearly seem to be better than others. We sometimes wonder whether we've picked the best entree and not just whether we'll like it. We experience *pad Thai* as good or bad. When we speak of these matters of gastronomic value, we do so in the declarative mood as though we mean to be stating facts about them. In the absence of compelling considerations to the contrary shouldn't we take our gastronomic experience at face value as we do with moral experience.

Admittedly, the character of our gastronomic experience is not wholly objective. But the same holds for *moral* experience. For example, many people when asked about morality say things like "It's all relative" or "I only know what's right for *me*". Conversely, it's easy to underestimate people's willingness to acknowledge the possibility of error in the gastronomic realism. In fact, claims about erroneous gastronomic judgments are rather commonplace. It wouldn't be odd for me to say that only a philistine would fail to recognize the superiority of Vermon Grade A Fancy maple syrup to *Log Cabin Lite*.

## The Argument from Disagreement
---
This is probably the most prominent objection that's being raised against moral realism. If moral properties are real and we are somehow able to apprehend them, it's argued, then why is there so much disagreement, some of it apparently intractable, about their nature? The best explanation for the diversity of moral opinion, is that we pick up our values from our culture and not from actual awareness of moral facts. But if so, why should we believe in the existence of moral facts at all?

A similar argument can be directed at GVPs. Disagreement about which foods are good are notoriously common.

In the moral case, we do not need to explain away *all* disagreement. Some questions are difficult and we should not expect for there to be determinate answers to all moral questions. Some cases can be expected to involve borderline indeterminacy.

Other times there will be irresolvable conflicts but among incommensurable but real moral values. Perhaps there is no metric for comparing the importance of preserving a forest with that of preserving a number of jobs in the timer industry, for instance. In such cases even if there is disagreement, this disagreement does not threaten the claim that moral facts exist.

Disagreements of these sorts should not trouble the gastronomic realist any more than they do the moral realist. Of course there still appears to be a lot of gastronomic disagreement of the more troubling kind, cases in which we should expect resolution if GVPs are real and we have reasonably good epistemic access to them. 

A good deal of this, like moral disagreement, can be explained as owing to simple ignorance of ordinary, non-evaluative facts. For example, gastronomic irrealists can take nothing from the fact that a child who refuses to taste tripe thinks macaroni and cheese better. Unless she has tasted the tripe, she is really in no position to make a comparative judgement. 

Another argument is that one's moral judgment can be distorted by too much of a focus on irrelevant non-moral facts (such as the fact that a given action will harm oneself), and this is a source of moral disagreement. Similarly, one's gastronomic judgment can be imparied by too much attention to facts irrelevant to questions of gastronomic value. For example, a kid may think haggis is excellent, until it's revealed what it is and now he thinks it is awful.

On a related note, the social nature of learning makes it likely that people from different cultures will have different gastronomic values, at least in the short run. Scientific knowledge does not typically come in a flash of personal insight. Instead, we rely on a vast array of intellectual forebearers, and differences in training may account for differences in perspective.

It should be no more surprising that people coming from different moral traditions sometimes have different views on moral questions than is the parallel fact about people from differing scientific traditions. Similarly, in the gastronomic context it shouldn't be a surprise if people from Thailand typically think Thai food better than Vietnamese. Their judgments are no less likely to be tied to cultural tradition than those we make in scientific and moral contexts.

Finally we should point out the very extensive agreement that we find on moral questions. Almost everyone thinks that fruits, sweets, and pasta are good. And no one thinks this of sand, sulfur, or cow manure.

Here its important to emphasize the importance of empirical research for this area of inquiry. Until we know more, we can expect conflict among philosophers about whether disagreement is a significant problem for either sort of realism.

## The Argument from Explanation
---
We can argue from the view that roughly it is sensible to believe in the existence of a kind of entity or property if and only if we can fit that entity or property into the best available explanatory schema. The challenge is then to show us how moral facts can explain and why we should believe they do/

Can GVPs explain? Of course they can. Why do people pay such high prices to eat at certain restaurants? Because the food is so good there! Why hasn't Ben and Jerry's came out with ketchup and onion flavored ice cream? Because that would be an awful flavor! We appeal to explanations of this sort all time.

## The Argument from Queerness
---
If there are moral properties, Mackie thought they would be a very odd sort of entity, and that we would need a correspondingly odd means of epistemic access to them. One respect in which moral properties would be odd is that they would have to combine two elements, the combination of which seems hard to fathom. These elements are *objectivity* and *prescriptivity*. Conceptual analysis reveals that moral statements would have to both describe the world and at the same time tell us what to do. Moreover the properties themselves would somehow have to supervene on ordinary natural properties. And one again we'd face an enormous epistemic demand, awareness of not only the supervening moral properties, but also the natural properties on which they depend, as well as the mysterious link between the two. Finally, moral properties would have to be the sort of things awareness of which brought with it overriding motivation to comply.
### Non-Naturalism and Metaphysical Queerness
One aspect of Mackie's queerness objection rested on his assumption that moral properties would have to be *sui generis*, belonging in a special ontological category all of their own: the *non-natural*. This claim raised a number of worries, perhaps the most significant is its apparent conflict with the widespread commitment to "ontological parsimony". In response, many moral realists have simply denied that moral properties must be non-natural. Moral properties are *[[Defining Physicalism|natural]]* properties just like any other. These properties supervene on other natural properties, like the property of being a table supervenes on the property of being a certain kind of collection of molecules.

Similarly, Gastronomic properties are natural properties that supervene on other natural properties such as the property of being salty, crunchy, bitter, or sweet. Thus no special metaphysical problem arises for gastronomic realism, and no issue of ontological parsimony arises either.

### *Epistemic* Queerness
How can we come to know particular moral facts? The problem seems particularly acute for non-naturalists. If moral properties are *sui generis*, occupying their own ontological realm, how is it that we're able to gain awareness of them? Mackie thought that the best answer a realist could give here would be to fall back on a mysterious faculty of intuition, through which we are able directly to apprehend at least some fundamental moral truths. Mackie thought such a faculty would be a very odd sort of faculty. Moreover its not clear how the wrongness of an act would *cause* us to judge that the act is wrong since there's no conceivable mechanism that can explain the link between the wrongness and our judgments of wrongness in a given case.

Similar arguments could be directed against gastronomic realism. However, since moral properties are natural properties we have no reason to worry about the possibility of epistemic access to some apparently remote ontological realm. Similarly, the gastronomic realist can claim that, GVPs being natural properties, knowledge of them seems unproblematic.

### Normativity
Mackie argued that moral properties would have to be the sort of thing knowledge of which produces in the knower an overriding motivation to act in accordance with their demands, a motivation not contingent upon the psychology of the knower. Claims about properties having this sort of power are highly implausible.

Once again, realists reject the claim that they are committed to entities of the sort Mackie imagines. Many alternatives are available: the moral facts motivate upon recognition but that they do not necessarily motivate overridingly, they needn't motivate on recognition but do provide us with reasons for action. More boldly, some realists deny that there must be any non-contingent connection between our moral beliefs and our motivations.

Gastronomic realists face a similar array of possibilities. They can deny that GVPs overridingly motivate upon recognition, etc.
