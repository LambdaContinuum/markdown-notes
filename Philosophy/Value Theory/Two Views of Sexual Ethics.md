The sexual revolution restricted the number of practices regarded as taboo. Promiscuity is widely accepted, but rape and pedophilia continue to be reviled.

Benatar argues that the view of sexual ethics that underlies an acceptance of promiscuity is inconsistent with regarding
1. Rape as worse than other forms of coercion or assault
2. Many sex acts with  with willing children as wrong at all.

A view of ethics that fully explains the wrongness of rape and pedophilia would rule out promiscuity.

# Two Views of Sexual Ethics
---
The first view is that for sex to be morally acceptable, it must be an expression of romantic love. It must signify feelings of affection that are commensurate with the intimacy of the sexual activity. Call this view the *significance view* because it requires sex to signify love in order for it to be permissible.

On the alternative view, what we call the *casual view*, sex doesn't need to have this significance in order to be morally permissible. On this view sexual pleasure is morally like any other pleasure and may be enjoyed subject only to the usual sorts of moral constraints. Gastronomic pleasure obtained via theft would be morally impermissible for example, but where no general moral principle applies, there is no fault in engaging in gastronomic pleasure. Erotic pleasures on this view may permissibly be obtained from sex with strangers or mere acquaintances, there need not be love or affection.

# Implications of the Two Views
---
We define someone as sexually promiscuous if they're casual about sex. Somebody for whom sex is not (or need not be) laden with romantic significance. The sexually promiscuous is one for whom romantic attachments are not a relevant consideration in choosing a sexual partner. It's clear why promiscuity is frowned upon by advocates of the significance view of sex. The promiscuous person treats as insignificant that which ought be significant.

The significance view also explains why pedophilia is wrong. Children are unable to appreciate the full significance that sexual activity should have. They may lack the capacity to understand how sex expresses a certain kind of love. Having sex with a child is thus to treat the child as a mere means to attaining erotic pleasure without consideration of the mental states of which the provision of that pleasure should be an expression.

The significance view of sex also provides an explanation for the special wrongness of rape. Raping people is not like forcing them to engage in other activities, such as going to dinner or the opera. It's to compel a person to engage in activity that should be an expression of deep affection.

If sex is morally just like other pleasurable activities and bears no special significance, why may it not be enjoyed with children? One common answer is that sex can be physically harmful to a child. But obviously not all pedophilic acts are of this kind. Psychological harm is another answer. It's not clear however as a number of authors writing on this topic have noted, to what extent that harm is the result of the sexual encounter itself and to what extent it is the result of the secrecy and taboo that surrounds that sexual activity. A defender of the causal view of sex cannot appeal to these harms in forming a principled objection to the sexual interaction between adults and children, because a society in which there were no taboos on pedophilia would avoid harm resulting from taboos on such activities and would simultaneously be inclusive of the pedophile's sexual orientation. At most, advocates of this view can say that the current psychological harms impose temporary moral constrains on sex with those children who, given their upbringing or circumstances, would experience psychological trauma.

It might be objected that it's impossible for a child to give genuine consent to sexual activity, and for this reason, it's always wrong to engage in sexual relations with a child. One may ask how this is compatible with the casual view. What is it about sex, so understood, that a child is unable to consent to it? On this view sex carries no special significance and thus there is nothing that a child needs to understand in order to enter into a permissible sexual encounter. Maybe one could point to possible health risks associated with casual sex. This fails.
1. Some sexual activities do not carry significant health risks.
2. Where children are not thought competent to evaluate the risks of an activity, it;s usually thought that a parent or guardian may, within certain risk limits, make the assessment on the child's behalf. Thus a parent may allow a child to participate in a sport that carries risks for example. If sex isn't more significant than these such activities, its hard to see why its risks (especially when safe sex makes these risks relatively small) and not those of the other activities constitute grounds for categorically excluding children and invalidating the consent which they or their parents give.

Maybe it's not that children cannot genuinely consent to sexual activity, but that given the differences between adults and children, it's not possible for an adult and child to understand one another's motives for wanting to have sex.  This mutual unintelligibility makes it impossible for each party to know even roughly what the encounter means to the other and the absence of this information compromises the validity of the content. This objection, like the previous one, is plausible on the significance view. It lacks force on the casual view. The absence of mutual intelligibility of motives is not thought to be an objection to other activities with children, such as playing a game, that are not thought to carry the significance attributes to sex by the significance view.

It's also not even evident on the casual view why children need to consent at all. If a parent may force a child into participating in a sport (say on grounds of character building), or into going to the opera (on grounds of learning to appreciate the arts), why can't a parent coerce a child into sex? Maybe the parent believes that treating sex as one does other aspects of life forestalls neurosis in the child and that gaining sexual experience while young is an advantage.

There may be dispute on whether interference with a child's freedom is justified, but few think its acceptable to interfere with the freedom of adults by, for example, forcing them to take up a sport, go to the opera, or eat something. Those who accept this, even if they have a casual view of sex, have grounds for finding rape of adults morally defective. The problem is, on the casual view, it's not clear that forcing someone to have sex is any more serious than forcing them to eat something. The casual view can explain why rape is wrong, but it cannot explain why it's especially wrong.  Maybe a proponent can explain why its especially wrong for someone who does not share the casual view, that is, for those who believe sex ought be significant. But this seems like a hard bullet to bite. Feminists have argued at length for the irrelevance, in rape trials, of a woman's sexual history. But if the casual view is correct, then her sexual history would be evidence of her view of sexual ethics. This in turn would be relevant to determining how great a harm the rape was. Raping somebody for whom sex has little significance as eating a tomato, would be like forcing somebody to eat a tomato. This seems wrong!

# Choosing between the Views
---
Some might take the above reflections to speak in favor of or against on the views. Those who are convinced that promiscuity is morally permissible may be inclined to think that the casual view might be correct because it supports this judgement. Others, who believe that pedophilia is wrong and that rape is a special kind of wrong and is unlike other violations of a person's body or autonomy, may think that the significance view is correct given that it can support these judgements.

There are other factors that are relevant to evaluation. Consider those that speak in favor of the significance view. This view fits well with judgements most people make about forms of intimacy that, although not sexual practices themselves, are not unrelated to the intimiacies of sex:
1. casually sharing news of one's venereal disease with
	1. a mere acquaintance, or
	2. with one's spouse or close family member
2. undressing
	1. in the street
	2. in front of one's spouse in the privacy of one's bedroom

Very few people feel the same about 1.1/2.1 as about 1.2/2.2 . This suggests most people think intimacies are appropriately shared only with those to whom one is close. The significance view seems to capture this important psychological feature about humans.

Is this psychological trait universal or are is it a cultural product? Well, viewing sex as significant is characteristic of all humanity or only of certain cultures is an empirical issue that psychologists and anthropologists should determine.

Hybrids of the two views might be possible. It may be that sex is not quite like other pleasures, but it need not be linked to the deepest forms of romantic love. Maybe, one just needs to like somebody in order to copulate. This mixed view doesn't resolve our problem. Any view that took a sufficiently light view of sex that would justify promiscuity would have difficulty ruling out all pedophile or classifying rape as the special wrong it's usually thought to be.

An intermediate view would (as the casual view does) deny that sex must be an expression of romantic affection, but (in common with the significance view) deny that sex is like other pleasures.

Consider two versions of this intermediate view:

1. Although sex need not be an expression of romantic affection, it's unlike other pleasures in that it's intimate or private. The latter part of this claim can be understood as descriptive or normative. The descriptive claim is that most people prefer to engage in sex with intimates or away from the view of others. The normative claim is that people ought to engage in sex only with intimates or away from the view of others. If the basis for these claims is that sex is or ought be a deep expression of romantic affection, then the view under discussion is either support for or a disguised version of the significance view rather than an alternative intermediate view. What other reason could there by for why sex is morally permissible between intimates? Perhaps there is some such reason for why sex is or ought be private. But what would be wrong, on this intermediate view, with private sex between an adult and a willing child? Why would coerced private sex be worse than other kinds of coerced activities in private? Any plausible answer to these questions would have to appeal to the normative significance of sex as an expression of affection and any such appeal could not lead to a special condemnation of rape and pedophilia without implying a condemnation of promiscuity
2. Sex is unlike other pleasures because it is "personally involving in ways that other pleasures are not". It seems that any interpretation of the view that sex is personally involving would lend support to a significance view of sex.
