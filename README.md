# Disclaimer
These notes are ported from my Obsidian folder, and so there will be the occasional artifact from it being written while using Obsidian. As the name of this repo suggests the contents of this repo are the notes I take while reading or listening to things so as a general rule they aren't well-structred/written.

# What are you using?
Since I'm no longer writing these in Obsidian (I found I didn't really use any plugins & don't structure my notes in such a way that obsidian is useful for) someone may ask what am I writing them with. It's just a directory of markdown files on my linux box. I edit them using neovim (with some plugins useful for markdown) and track them with git.
