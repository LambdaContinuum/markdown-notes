## 1940s
---
 - Turing launches the world of Computing
	 - General Computing
	 - Theory of Computation
	 - Turing Machine
	 - Turing Test

- Some people say the Turing Test is the beginning of AI as a concept.
	- They would be wrong but it's colloquially known as the birth of AI

## Sky's the Limit (1950-1969)
---
- Dartmouth Workshop (1956)
	- 2 months long
	- Focus on "intelligent" programs

- Result: some impressive systems!
	- Checkers player <-- Tree [[Search|search]] + Heuristics
	- Logic Theorist (proofs) <-- Simple proofs: Couldn't do complicated ones

- Hopes where high!
	- General Problem Solver (GPS), also known as AGI.
	- Fueled by Lots of R&D during the Cold War
		- Russian to English Translation
		- Robotics
		- Etc.

## The Crash: The First AI Winter
---
- None of the promises were kept
	- Poor machine translation
	- Poor robotics
	- etc.

- "Intelligence" is fuzzy
- Hard to fool humans (i.e. pass the Turing test)

- Perceptrons (1969) (also called generation 1 neural networks)
	- When we talk about Neural Networks we typically talk about generation 2.
	- Minsky  + Papert book on Perceptrons
	- Largely critical
	- Proved perceptron could only solve linearly separable problems
		- Not hard to solve, it's a subclass of all the problems you can solve. Considered "easy".
	- Big hit to those believing "intelligent" machines must mimic the brain.

- Lighthill report (1973)
	- Evaluated state of AI field
	- Conclusion: Hype overblown
	- Correct at the time but it had consequences
		- R&D drastically reduced
		- Called the first AI winter

## Resurgence (early 1980s)
---
- Commercial Product success
- Rule based systems (also called expert systems)
	- Designed by experts
	- "If-then" design

- AAAI conference founded
	- Largest AI conference

## The Second AI Winter (1984-1995)
---
- Rule based systems are trash
	- Nice for small, niche tasks
	- Rigid
	- Combinatorial explosion of states
		- Ex: Chess
			- 20 possible first moves
			- 400 possible second moves
			- ...
			- 4.8M 5th moves
	- Need experts to "divine" rules

## Resurgence II (1995+)
---
- Hardware saves AI
- Deep Blue (1996)
	- Chess bot
	- Went toe-to-toe with Garry Kasparov (world champ)

- First GPU (commercially available) in 1999
	- Originally designed to make Linear Algebra very fast.
	- Made Neural Networks possible (Backprop Alg already discovered).
		- It was originally a thought-experiment, it was a model but it was too computationally expensive.

- Numerical computing boom (including AI)
